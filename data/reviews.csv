2023-03-19,The Wolf of Wall Street,2013,https://boxd.it/401rd1,5,Yes,"One of my favorite movies of all time. Admittedly a lot of it is with the circumstances of my first viewing. 

I watched this for the first time in theaters in December 2013, just rewatched it again. My first viewing was when I just started college (and was a sucker for anything raunchy). This hit me a certain way because it was not only raunchy but also meticulously crafted. A super long runtime, but always engrossing. Still can’t believe a lot of the scenes actually happened in real life. Leo deserved the Oscar for this.",,2023-02-18
2023-03-19,Forrest Gump,1994,https://boxd.it/401wWv,5,,"This film always holds a special place in my heart. A great retelling of US history through a fascinating character. Groundbreaking visual effects for its time. Probably the first time I remember where visual effects were utilized smartly, rather than just for actiony explosions.",,
2023-03-19,Last Night in Soho,2021,https://boxd.it/405z2t,4,,"I’m a fan of all of Edgar Wright’s prior films - they have smart humor and meticulous editing. So I was very interested to see his next film in a very different genre. I love it when artists venture against type - the best example is writer Craig Mazin who started with movies like the Hangover sequels and then randomly gave us Chernobyl. Another cool example is Todd Philips who went from directing the Hangover movies to Joker (funny how both of these examples include the Hangover)

I was fully engrossed through the runtime of Last Night in Soho, due to 2 major things:
1) Unique visuals. The shots between Thomasin McKenzie and Anya Taylor-Joy’s characters were so meticulously edited. I’m glad Edgar Wright brought this signature into a different type of film. In addition, the pros and cons of the 1960s were visually captured vividly. 
2) Ellie (portrayed by Thomasin McKenzie) is a solid lead character. She comes with a rural innocence, a slightly haunting past, a fascination by the 1960s, and a dream for a future in fashion. We want her to be happy, but reality kicks in as she realizes that demeaning and immoral people exist and may push her away from her happy future.

As for cons, in hindsight certain plot points and choices had inconsistencies. They didn’t make me hate the film in the end, but I wish more thought was put into connecting things together. 

Still, I was on board for the ride. I also always have a soft spot for films that don’t fit into a singular genre. This is not a cookie cutter film by any means. Even though I didn’t agree with every choice, I could tell that thought was put into each frame and I have to commend that.",,2023-03-17
2023-03-19,Goodbye,2022,https://boxd.it/40en0X,4,,"Heartwarming, with a couple humorous scenes. A nice explanation of what makes up the funeral process in Hindu culture. I’m a fan of anything Amitabh Bachchan does - I love his range of film involvement. 

The film had some scenes that dragged too long though. A perfect version of this film would be 45 minutes shorter.",,2023-03-18
2023-03-21,Colossal,2016,https://boxd.it/40PdUb,1.5,,"I always look forward to films with a unique premise. And I typically rate those films higher than normal because uniqueness typically adds to how much I appreciate a film. Unfortunately, I can’t do that for Colossal. 

I love the premise of this movie. An imperfect individual is randomly in control of a giant creature in Seoul. That has so much comedy potential. And I saw that comedy potential in every scene that Anne Hathaway + company acted fun and silly together. 

But, this film decided to try so much more and it just ended up messy. A subplot where Anne Hathaway’s character is kicked out and her ex is trying to win her back. Jason Sudeikis having a complete 180 degree in character choices for no reason. And a final resolution that was so ludicrous that I couldn’t help but facepalm. All this took away from the uniqueness that I wanted to appreciate so much.",,2023-03-20
2023-03-22,Rocky II,1979,https://boxd.it/40Tgjv,5,,"A sequel that I actually like more than the original!

I liked the original and definitely appreciate its impact on film, but I felt that some scenes weren’t as cleanly edited together as I wanted. 

Rocky II is stitched together perfectly in my opinion. From the start, I could tell this sequel was actually justified. Rocky Balboa and Apollo Creed enter Rocky II in a way that makes sense. Rocky is suddenly famous and doesn’t know how to navigate the new fame. Apollo didn’t expect a tough fight and feels like he lost even though he technically won. I’m thankful we got a chance to view the aftermath of the fight from the prior film - it’s a story I actually cared about viewing. 

Rocky’s journey back into the ring was fascinating to me. At first it’s great - he buys expensive things without much thought. But then the sponsorships and endorsements just don’t sit well with him. It doesn’t feel genuine to him, and we agree as a viewer of the film. Even if he could cruise for the rest of his life with the financial fame from the original fight, he is first and foremost a boxer. He tries going back into boxing, but his wife’s initial disapproval hinders him from giving it his all. He then drops everything to care for his wife during a pregnancy complication. Once she is better and approves of the return to boxing, he is able to give it his all. 

The final fight was a thrilling show. I was so invested that It felt like I was watching a real fight. It all went naturally how you’d expect based on how you know the characters. Rocky is still the underdog and Apollo will not play easy this time around. Ultimately, the one with the better mental game won. 

Finally, this made me really appreciate Sylvester Stallone. Today he’s sorta known as just a macho guy making typical macho films. Two films in, the Rocky franchise has more depth than I expected. And in Rocky II, he even directed it (along with writing it and acting as the main character). I look forward to check out the rest of his work, I bet there are more hidden gems out there.",,2023-03-21
2023-03-23,Women Talking,2022,https://boxd.it/41agnV,4.5,,"This reminded me a lot like Aaron Sorkin’s screenplay work. Snappy dialogue elevated this film to a thrilling level. Definitely worthy of the Oscar for adapted screenplay. 

If a similar topic of conversation occurred today, we’d likely see similar points brought up. This made it very investing to see how the film would ultimately conclude.",,2023-03-11
2023-03-23,Last Seen Alive,2022,https://boxd.it/41b5gV,2,,"A time pass thriller. Didn’t really do anything wrong or bad per se, it was just strongly normal. There are many other better thrillers out there.",,2023-03-08
2023-03-23,The Hangover Part III,2013,https://boxd.it/41b7YF,1.5,,"This trilogy should’ve just been a one and done movie. Clearly part 2 and part 3 only exist to make money. 

I slightly prefer part 3 over part 2, mainly because I appreciated that they tried a different genre with the same characters. I would like to see more franchises that can take risks with varied genres in the same franchise. Unfortunately, not much was done with the risk for part 3. Most jokes didn’t land, and I really couldn’t stand Ken Jeong’s character. Frankly, I was just waiting for the movie to end.",,2023-03-04
2023-03-23,Chernobyl,2019,https://boxd.it/41bhwV,5,,"An absolutely thrilling ride. 

There are many disaster films out there. What set this mini-series apart was what happens when a disaster takes place in a socialist regime like the Soviet Union.

A normal disaster film generally displays to us from the start why a disaster happened, and every character is focused on curbing the effects of the disaster. In Chernobyl, most of the first half was leaders downplaying the disaster, and the political backlash against people trying to curb the effects. It emphasizes the importance of our political leaders doing their job if, god-forbid, a disaster were to occur. The heroic work we see is further elevated, knowing that if they did survive they could end up getting punished by political leaders.",,2023-03-16
2023-03-24,Daddy Day Care,2003,https://boxd.it/41x4Bd,3,Yes,"Revisited a childhood classic of mine, and it still holds up. My second favorite childhood memory of Eddie Murphy (after Shrek).",,2023-02-04
2023-03-24,The Menu,2022,https://boxd.it/41xcQF,5,,"What a unique premise!

Yes, there are social commentary connections you can make with this film. I frankly just liked this on the surface level of an unpredictable plot. I had no idea what direction the film was going, and I was all for it. 

I never thought it would be possible for Ralph Fiennes to play a character scarier than Voldemort. Who would’ve expected that not only would that occur, but it would be as a chef…

This film is further elevated with smart humorous dialogue and stellar performances across the board. 

I still can’t get over how unique of a film this is. There is no single genre that can describe this film, and I doubt we’ll ever see a film similar to this again.",,2023-02-09
2023-03-24,Moonfall,2022,https://boxd.it/41xmGF,4.5,,"Is this a groundbreaking piece of art? No. Do I care? Also no!

The Room is typically cited as the best “so bad, it’s good” film. I get the charm of The Room, but I never really felt a strong need to revisit it for fun. 

I 100% would host an annual movie night to watch Moonfall. The ridiculousness levels perfectly escalate through the runtime. Without spoiling anything, the concept of the moon crashing towards Earth is frankly one of the more normal parts of this film. 

To anyone giving this film a bad review: did you really expect perfection or though-provoking art going into this? If so, you watched this film very wrong.",,2023-02-13
2023-03-24,Primer,2004,https://boxd.it/41xszZ,4,,"Mainstreams films that involve time travel usually gloss over the science and logic behind the time travel to focus on the thrilling sequences from the plot. Primer flips that focus. 

Wow. What a big-brain film. Respect to anyone that can watch this film and actually understand it. I understood maybe 10% of this film, and subsequently needed hours of YouTube videos explaining what I just watched. I definitely need to watch this again at some point to solve this puzzle. 

Huge kudos to the filmmakers that created something so thoughtful on a puny budget. It makes me want to say that films with a sloppy screenplay really have no excuse 😂

I’m docking one star on this, mainly because I’m personally not the biggest fan of super big brain films. Doesn’t detract from the respect I have for the film though.",,2023-02-14
2023-03-27,Pathaan,2023,https://boxd.it/42qGKd,1.5,,"Aggressively fine is how I’d describe this. 

I get the hype and anticipation around this - Shah Rukh Khan’s first film in five years. He has strong charisma and charms audiences. I myself am a huge fan too, I’ve grown up watching his movies. However, his later movies haven’t really had the same charm and legacy as his earlier movies. I feel the same way about Pathaan- I doubt this will really be a “timeless classic”. I wish I could see Shah Rukh Khan do more unique roles again like Chak De India or Dear Zindagi. 

A lot of things just felt slightly off here. I think I would pinpoint this to inconsistent tones. The dialogue had some serious lines and then some cheesy lines - it would’ve been nice to just commit one way or the other. The chemistry between Shah Rukh Khan and Deepika Padukone’s characters felt more forced than fun. 

All the actors look great as action stars, but I couldn’t get into the action fully due to the subpar visual effects. I understand that Indian films have an exponentially lower budget than US blockbusters so by no means do I expect Mission Impossible quality. But, a lot of the action scenes unfortunately looked like blatant green screen so I couldn’t feel the tension that the film wanted me to. I don’t remember feeling this sane way about the visual effects for other films in this YRF Spy Universe like Ek Tha Tiger or War. 

This film trying showing off a lot of spectacle but it didn’t stick the landing for me. I think that there needs to be more focus on original screenplay than trying to imitate Hollywood spectacle. RRR got a huge worldwide following because, despite visual effects not being completely on par with Hollywood, it embraced and built upon Indian culture and storytelling and felt fresh to audiences. 

Two positives I will say about Pathaan:
1) I bought John Abraham’s villainous motive. While he was doing terrorist actions, I understood why he felt he was doing the right thing. 
2) The continuation of this YRF Spy Universe is pretty cool. I would totally see an “Avengers” film in this universe that pulls Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan, and Hrithik Roshan into the same movie.",,2023-03-26
2023-04-01,Rocky III,1982,https://boxd.it/43wGJZ,3.5,,"Even though I think the first and second films are better, I’m content that this third film is actually justified. This doesn’t seem like an overdone franchise so far, and I hope to feel the same way as I watch the rest. 

Like the last one, this film is a natural next story following Rocky II. It made sense for Rocky to hit an athletic peak at the end Rocky II, and then stagnate and slowly drop. A new character as a foil to Rocky was perfect to tell this story. 

I also appreciated the friendship between Rocky and Apollo. They were rivals in the past, and then the mutual respect blossomed into a friendship. 

I’m strongly mixed on the tonal shift of this film. While the previous films felt real, this one added parts that felt like a caricature. Hulk Hogan’s fight and Clubber Lang’s persona were very fun (and it was great to learn this is where Mr. T’s “I pity the fool!” originated), but the placement into a Rocky franchise just felt odd. 

I also really didn’t buy the relevation that Mickey gave to Rocky after the statue unveiling scene. I feel like Rocky would’ve been smart enough to figure that out himself. Unfortunately, a lot of the motivation in the film depends on buying into this.",,2023-03-30
2023-04-01,Varudu Kaavalenu,2021,https://boxd.it/43EOWj,1,,"This started as a typical cute romcom, and went so downhill in the second half. 

The first half introduced the girl with a unique personality as the owner of a small business and has a demeaning presence. We expect to soon hear background on why she’s like that. Instead, the second half decides to avoid that question, and turn into a typical Telugu movie with many silly conveniences. 

A huge nitpick I had was that the boy came from Dubai, but characters kept saying he came from Paris.",,2023-03-31
2023-04-10,Beast,2022,https://boxd.it/463Yo5,4,,"A creature feature filmed very well!

I don’t really get why this got mediocre reviews - I was thoroughly invested through the whole film’s thrills. 

The natural visuals of the African wilderness are absolutely beautiful. I also loved the night shots - they didn’t seem super dark or a cheap ploy to get around an easier visual effects process. 

There are many one shots, and I have no idea how they filmed those shots. The one shots definitely move it up above an average thriller level. 

I totally believed Idris Elba’s role in this film. He plays a doctor and a father trying to reconnect with his daughters, while also being a character that’s somewhat competent with weapons and hurting lions. That’s a lot of buy-in to expect from the audience, but I bought it since he’s a great actor. 

Docking one star because one of the characters has many stupid decisions out of the blue, seemingly just to increase the tension. They could’ve put some effort in a couple moments to naturally build the tension. Even something as little as a lion cracking a car window would’ve prevent the need for stupid decisions.",,2023-04-08
2023-04-10,Kimi,2022,https://boxd.it/4645NB,4.5,,"An engrossing contained thriller!

Most of the film focuses on Zoe Kravitz’s character, and she had an excellent performance here. I bought everything about her character background and her decisions. 

A slight tangent, but this showcases a great reason why I appreciate the art of film. Many throwaway films can have a throwaway supervillain flying through skyscrapers and killing many people, but somehow there is just no tension or fear. On the other hand, some of Kimi’s scariest moments is just an agoraphobe walking outside. You don’t need millions of CGI dollars to invest your audience - you just need to flesh out your characters and have a purpose behind Dutch angles. 

If you’re a Home Alone fan like me - there’s a reference here that’s perfection. 

Dropping a half star because the very end went a normal thriller route, and I would’ve expected something more unique given how the rest of the film was. It didn’t tank the film for me though.",,2023-04-08
2023-04-10,M3GAN,2022,https://boxd.it/464dHB,3.5,,"Solid B-movie thriller!

Many critic reviews seem to focus on saying something like “this is great for a film released in January”. I don’t like doing that - the legacy of a film shouldn’t rely on its release date, but on the film itself. 

I’m astonished by how low this budget is given how realistic M3gan looked. I didn’t observe any bad CGI or obvious puppeteering. 

My favorite parts were the moments of focusing on the social dangers of AI. The idea of a child’s development corrupted by an AI powered toy is scarier to me than a murdering toy. I really wish the AI social commentary was explored more, instead of the horror kills.

This film clearly got all the hype from social media, like TikToks for the M3gan dance. Honestly… pretty smart marketing.",,2023-04-05
2023-04-10,Marcel the Shell with Shoes On,2021,https://boxd.it/465eId,4,,"Another example of the fact that quality original content still exists!

The premise of this alone still astounds me - major credit to the filmmakers on the concept alone. And not only is it such a unique concept; it’s family-friendly. I’ve grown up watching films through childhood and that’s really what got me into a love for film. As an adult, a part of me is sad that some of the greatest/artistic films are too inappropriate to be accessible to children. Thankfully, Marcel the Shell with Shoes On can have shared appreciation for all ages. 

I was captivated solely on Marcel’s innocent outlook to new experiences. Adorable and thought-provoking. 

I’m docking one star simply because it didn’t personally connect with me all that way. This is really less a fault on the film and more on movie - I totally understand people that would love this movie.",,2023-04-05
2023-04-16,Rocky IV,1985,https://boxd.it/47HPbF,3.5,,"Another justified film in the franchise!

I’m content that four films in, we still have actual reason to follow the characters and buy into their arcs. Today’s franchises really need to take notes from the Rocky franchise. 

I appreciated Apollo Creed’s death as the center of this film. Apollo’s cockiness was consistent with his personality of the previous films, so it made sense that he wanted to stay in the ring with Ivan Drogo until his eventual demise. This death also gives believable motivation for Rocky to fight Ivan. Finally, a death in the ring further shows just how dangerous boxing is, which adds a lot of tension for the final fight. 

While reading upon the production background, I learned that the boxing scenes were legitimately filmed. In one instance, Sylvester Stallone got heart swelling and needed to be urgently transported to the hospital. In another instance, Carl Weathers almost quit the film because of a fight scene with Dolph Lundgren going way too overboard. Huge respect for shooting practical shots. 

Couple things didn’t work for me here:
- The robot “character” was super weird and didn’t fit into the overall tone. 
- Ivan’s backstory seemed cartoonish. He was displayed as a Russian manufactured object with no personality. This came off to me more as comical than scary. 
- The middle has multiple back-to-back montages. While all filmed well, it got overboard. 
- While the final fight scenes were shot practically, somehow I didn’t feel that way compared to the final fight of Rocky II. I think it’s because this final fight had many quick edits, so we didn’t stay sustained enough in singular shots to feel realistic. 
- The US vs. Russia sentiment got very heavy handed, especially with Rocky’s speech at the end. I get that this film came out during Soviet times, but that speech is not believable to be made by Rocky. He fought to avenge Apollo, not for his country. 

I’ve heard that all these cons were addressed in the directors cut of the film. I would love to check that out someday.",,2023-04-14
2023-04-21,Missing,2023,https://boxd.it/491ZqJ,4.5,,"Searching was one of my favorite films in the year it came out. Still can’t forget that theater experience. The “screenlife” aspect wasn’t just a gimmick, but a smartly edited and investing storytelling medium through the whole runtime. 

Missing was made by the same creators, so there’s no surprise that it’s also amazing!

I was afraid of this falling into a sequel trope, where it just copies a lot from the original and doesn’t have its own flavor. In many ways, it shares similar aspects to the original. But, the thrill was so engrossing that I truly didn’t care - why deviate from a formula that works so well?

I think what made this feel fresh enough for me was the switch in relationship. In Searching, the daughter is missing and the father is searching. This explored the father’s attempts to try being a protective father without pushing boundaries. On the other hand in Missing, the daughter is searching and the mother is missing. This explored the daughter’s yearn for independence, and then appreciating her mother’s love once she is missing. While very similar plot points, we could explore what would happen if the roles were reversed. 

Storm Reid was excellent in this. The whole film rests basically on her performance. I’m sure there’s an extra level of skill needed to act through webcam cameras all the time, and she sold everything. In addition, her character makes smart decisions at every turn - probably smarter than the everyday audience member. That helps with rooting for her character through the runtime. 

Another thing that makes this film stand out is the screenplay - very strongly written mystery thriller. It could still exist as an engrossing film even without the screenlife schtick. Just when you think you witnessed every twist, there’s more coming. 

I do slightly prefer Searching over Missing. This is likely a huge bias since I saw Searching first, so I’m curious to hear from others that saw Missing first. But, another reason was that I could actually believe Searching could occur in real life. Missing had a lot of conveniences to buy into. None of the conveniences detracted me from the thrill, but it was enough to make me feel it wasn’t perfectly realistic.",,2023-04-19
2023-05-01,The Lost City,2022,https://boxd.it/4bN2Vn,3,,"An enjoyable brainless comedy. 

I just went through a long work week and finished the first semester of my masters. After all that, I wanted to watch a movie but not a type that required my full attention to detail. The Lost City was perfect for my mood at this time. 

Yes, you could easily nitpick this movie and observe all the inconsistencies. Yes, you could say that this is ridiculously silly. Yes, there are other rom-coms that are more robustly edited together. Just don’t think that too much and you’ll have a fun ride. 

What elevated this movie beyond the forgettable realm was the characters - I’d happily watch another film with Sandra Bullock, Channing Tatum, Daniel Radcliffe, and Brad Pitt playing these characters again. 

While this isn’t amazing or iconic, I’m glad this movie was successful and I hope we can continue to get more movies like this.",,2023-04-29
2023-05-02,The Sound of Music,1965,https://boxd.it/4ca91x,5,,"This is an absolute joy from start to finish and still holds up so well. 

I definitely listened to the songs before and enjoy them. But, going into it I was afraid this would be like many other older movies - much slower pace compared to today’s films and may feel like a chore to sit through. Totally did not experience that :)

It may have a super long run time, but I genuinely did not want it to end! I was closely engrossed into every scene with a giant smile on my face. Maria’s love of life is infectious. Each of the kids have a joyful innocence. 

Each musical number fit so well with the plot of the film. The cinematography of the scenes were an absolute joy. 

We need more family-friendly movies like this made today. Most comedies today are either safe animated children’s films or stoner comedies. Nothing in between. I’m confident if another film like The Sound of Music was made today, it would be very very successful. Hollywood, I hope you read this review and act upon it.",,2023-04-01
2023-05-02,The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,2008,https://boxd.it/4caljN,3,,"A sorta normal movie elevated by David Fincher’s direction. 

As of this review, I watched every David Fincher movie except The Game and Mank. For now, I’d rank The Curious Case of Benjamin Button at the lowest of his films. Not necessarily a jab at this film, more that Fincher makes great films 🙂

Admittedly, I think I would’ve appreciated this film much more if I watched it at the time it was released. I think I would’ve appreciated the unique schtick of a backwards aging human, and really appreciated the visual effects it took to create this. 

All these years later, Benjamin Button has become joked about so much that I think it lessened the uniqueness of the concept for me. It felt like I just watched Brad Pitt’s character experience life. Definitely a well directed life by David Fincher, but there wasn’t really much more than that. 

Visual effects are definitely strong - I didn’t pinpoint any blatant CGI. But, de-aging has become a common technology now so it’s hard for me to praise the visual effects that many other films are now doing too. 

That being said, I don’t think I can sleep well at night if I gave this a negative review. All the acting is great, the world is well realized, Fincher’s direction is solid, and clearly every cast and crew member brought their A-game. It’s worth a one-time watch, but I don’t see myself revisiting this again.",,2023-04-21

2023-05-06,Rocky V,1990,https://boxd.it/4dcOAh,3,,"A fine addition to the franchise. I’m neither angry with its existence nor was upset with missed opportunities. 

This had a good number of positive aspects, despite how much fans (and Stallone himself) try to forget this film. I like that this film went the direction of Rocky becoming a mentor for Tommy Gunn, and then actually fights him in the end. I like that this went small scale rather than trying to one-up an international fight from Rocky IV. I like that Rocky’s love of boxing was distracting him from being a proper from his son, and then seeing the consequences of this. 

A couple scenes got really cheesy, which makes me agree that this is the worst so far in the franchise. Not bad though. Other franchises have had much worse (like Fallen Kingdom and Dominion for Jurassic Park, or Alien Resurrection for Alien)",,2023-05-04
2023-05-07,Dune,2021,https://boxd.it/4dwofx,5,,"Proof that a film can have both depth and a strong theater experience!

My biggest regret is that I didn’t watch this film in theaters. I will definitely watch Part 2 in IMAX later this year. 

The visual effects are absolutely breathtaking. I was completely immersed in this world. Literally every shot can be a solid movie poster on a wall.  There really is no other film world like this one, as far as I know. 

My biggest concern going into this movie was that it would be so deep into lore that only fans of the book series can follow along. Thankfully, it was not complicated. It had a solid amount of story and smartly educated the viewer about the rules of this world, without feeling too exposition heavy. 

It seems like lots of criticisms center around the fact that this film is only a first half of the story. I really don’t get why that should be a criticism. It’s not like the studio assembly line franchises that make certain films just to set up the next one in the franchise (e.g. the Julia Louis-Dreyfuss scenes in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever). This film just told a story and put a bookmark in the middle, in my opinion. 

Denis Villeneuve, you are one of the best working directors today. Your films have both spectacle and depth. I will always look forward to anything you do!",,2023-05-06
2023-05-09,"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",2023,https://boxd.it/4e5APx,4,,"A solid coming-of-age story. 

This was one of the few movies where I went into it knowing absolutely nothing (other than it’s based on a book). 

Personally I don’t believe in the idea that I obviously won’t like a movie if I’m not the target audience. Yes, certain groups of people may love certain genres more than others. But, if a film is made well enough, it can connect with any viewer. For example, I’m nothing like the characters in Mean Girls but I still enjoy watching that and laugh at all the jokes. 

This film is about a sixth grade girl that navigates problems like navigating what religion she is, boys noticing her, wanting big boobs, and expecting her first period. I obviously don’t relate to any of that, but I was engrossed with witnessing how Margaret navigates these issues. 

It was also relieving to see a film set in the 1980s. Away from social media or smartphones - we see the the kids have fun with things like running through sprinklers rather than Snapchat filters. 

Docking one star only because there wasn’t really anything groundbreaking here. I’m sure it will connect well to some people that see it at a certain age. But there really isn’t much more for me to rave about it (or even watch it again).",,2023-05-05
2023-05-13,Galaxy Quest,1999,https://boxd.it/4eTC1J,5,,"This is likely the best parody movie to ever exist. Go watch it if you haven’t already! 

Most parody movies don’t really go into it with a goal of trying to be “good”. They seem to lean heavily into the “so bad it’s good” realm (e.g. Sharknado) and run by with just references to what they are poking fun at. And especially if you haven’t seen (or even like) the source material (e.g. Spaceballs*), you won’t take much away from the parody movie.

The best praise I can give to Galaxy Quest is that it is able to exist on its own. A lot of this film is similar to the Star Trek world. I personally have a pretty basic knowledge of Star Trek, but I was still very engrossed in Galaxy Quest. I’m sure Star Trek knowledge would elevate this film further, but it’s definitely not necessary to enjoy the film. 

Despite the film definitely being a comedy, there is a perfect amount of actual tension. I found myself actually at the edge of my seat during the third act - I can’t even say that about many actual action films made today. 

The concept of this film is very fresh. This could’ve gone a typical parody route and have the characters actually be spaceship managers. Instead, they were washed up actors of spaceship managers in an actual spaceship. This brings a lot of comedy that just writes itself, but also brings tension because of how incompetent they actually are for the tasks at hand. I expected the concept to get tired by the halfway point, but it really didn’t. 

It’s also interesting to view this many years later. This film very well predicted the craziness of today’s fandom, both in positive and negative aspects. Similarly, It’s so funny to me that Sigourney Weaver and Alan Rickman were cast in this film. Sigourney Weaver was the iconic Ellen Ripley in the Alien films, and Alan Rickman would later be Snape in the Harry Potter films. I bet they have experienced similar levels of weird fandom as they played actual iconic characters before. 

There are two side actors in this film that I didn’t know were in it beforehand. Not gonna spoil it if you don’t know, but once I saw them I randomly got so happy and so much more excited to experience the rest of this film. 

This was not a cookie-cutter, assembly line parody film generated from the movie executives. There was a lot of thought actually put into this. People wanting smart comedy will get that. People wanting thrills will get that too. 

*Don’t interpret this as me saying Spaceballs is bad. I definitely enjoyed that movie. I’m merely making the point that appreciating Spaceballs depends on knowing Star Wars.",,2023-05-11
2023-05-15,Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery,1997,https://boxd.it/4fkPQz,3,,"Great hero and villain caricatures in an ok film. 

My improv class recently had a final show, and some of my classmates played Dating Game. In this game, someone is on a Dating Game show interviewing three contestants. Each contestant plays a character suggested by the audience. One of the contestants was “Dr. Evil” - the audience laughed at all the clues, and the guesser guessed correctly. I felt embarrassed that I didn’t understand any of these reference (in fact, didn’t even know this was a part of the Austin Powers universe), so I knew I had to catch up on knowledge by watching this film. 

I understand why this film series has a cult following. Mike Myers is super talented. Austin Powers and Dr. Evil are hilarious characters. Many of the innuendos and references to old James Bond films are on point. In a way, I’m glad this franchise exists because it forced James Bond films to movie to the serious route than continue silly tones.

This film is definitely thrilling - I was invested and looking forward to explore where the plot was going. I overall was on board with all the plot choices made here. 

But in hindsight, I don’t really feel like anything groundbreaking or hugely unique occurred here. And I don’t feel super enthusiastic to advertise that people have to watch this film.

2023-05-21,The Kerala Story,2023,https://boxd.it/4gKRIt,4,,"Note: This film has come across heavy controversy in India, for potentially factual inaccuracies and phobic propaganda. I really don’t want to add to controversy, so I’m not going to comment directly on the touchy topics or my opinions on them. I’ll only discuss the filmmaking here.
In addition, unrelated to this specific film: I’ve seen many political films either praised or criticized, purely based on the political affiliation of the critic. I wish critics did a better job of reviewing the filmmaking with a neutral viewpoint, and then separating their political thoughts in another segment. 

Before watching this film, I was curious to hear why someone could potentially be convinced into a dangerous ideology. What this film does a really good job of is showing how the convincing is so effective. Target people that seem to not have strong personal opinions. Personally dig into tragedies that occurred in their past, and share how your ideology would’ve prevented that tragedy. Have many individuals involved in varying degrees of “good cop, bad cop”. And on top of that, have no concrete proof that all this happened so you can “legally” get away with it. This is what made the film particularly gut-wrenching for me: this is very real and can easily happen to anyone we know. 

This is a really difficult and graphic watch, but I think it’s not over-the-top. It’s done to enough of a degree to show just how tragic the circumstances are. 

The film makes a narrative choice to concurrently follow three timelines:
1) Shalini getting interviewed by the authorities
2) Shalini’s background that led to her conversion (which is the content of her interview)
3) Shalini’s life post-conversion (which then eventually also becomes the content of her interview)
Surprisingly, all this is actually easy to follow and not confusing. But, I couldn’t help but wish this was done chronologically instead. It would’ve added much more tension on wondering if she would make it out alive. I get the goal of this film was to bring awareness of the topic (as opposed to being a fictional thriller), but I still view this as a better film structure.",,2023-05-18
2023-05-23,Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,2023,https://boxd.it/4hmVKT,1,,"ChatGPT input: write the next MCU film
ChatGPT output: Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania

I came out of this film even more frustrated with the state of the MCU. I wish they would move efforts to focusing on quality instead of quantity, this is really getting out of hand. Everything just felt like corporate creations with no heart or joy. 

This is best contrasted with Dune. Dune is a world that hasn’t been majorly visualized before by mainstream audiences in the 21st century. But, Villeneuve’s film truly immersed you into the world. This was done not just by the amazing visual effects, but by the character development and story and scope all coming together perfectly. The rules of the world are also fascinating: sand worms, shields, spice, and so much more. Despite how many films exist, the world of Dune feels so fresh and unique amongst any other film world. I came out of Dune eagerly awaiting to hear more stories around this world. 

Similarly, the Quantum Realm was never majorly visualized up until this film. We’ve seen scenes here and there in prior MCU films, but never actually living in it until this film. Our imagination should run wild what to expect here. But, we’re not given the time to immerse into this world. And the world really isn’t that fascinating - we see human-like appearances in generally normal clothing and human-like bars. Anything that could be potentially perceived with a “wow” remark ends up just being setup for a stupid one-off joke. 
I was equally underwhelmed with the multiverse as shown in <i>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</i>. You have access to literally multiple universes, and pizza balls is the most creative thing we witness here??

Then there’s the overall premise. It all depends on two huge conveniences. 
1) Ant-Man’s daughter is super into science and technology, and she just tinkered around to find a way to get into the Quantum Realm. We’ve seen many other teenage geniuses in the MCU. I bought Peter Parker since he’s Spider-Man and got superpowers. I bought Shuri because she is in Wakanda, which is basically a different world from the rest of Earth. I started to lose believability with Ironheart in <i>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever </i>because that had almost no backstory and it was just clearly setup for the next Disney+ show. Now, we got even less setup in this film. And on top of that, she had no backstory with fighting but we have to believe that she can fight huge armies and win. 
2) Janet had a huge scarring history in the Quantum Realm with Kang spanning multiple years, but told no one about it until Ant-Man’s daughter opens up to the Quantum Realm. 

Many people praised Kang in this film. I agree that Jonathan Majors is good, but I worry about the buildup to him becoming the next Thanos. There are many Kang versions - will we see a different version (and therefore completely different character arcs) in each film? Is it worth investing in each Kang version?

The prior Ant-Man films weren’t necessarily my favorites, but at least they had great jokes. Here, the writing seemed to be exponentially worse with comedy. It felt like there were no jokes for some time, then they realized they have to add a joke so they inappropriately shoehorned a joke in. 

In addition, there was no connection between the prior Ant-Man films and this one. Michael Peña and crew are not here, and they had natural comic relief in the past films. While I disagreed with the weird comedy nature in the Quantum Realm, Michael Peña and crew would’ve been a hilarious juxtaposition with this vibe. Instead, those people are forgotten and the focus was on the new character of Ant-Man’s daughter. 
The Wasp and Michael Douglas were also not done justice here. They were supposed to be very smart and important characters in the past, but here they were basically forgotten. 

Before watching this film, I didn’t realize that MODOK is a huge Marvel villain. MODOK was definitely not done well here - not that menacing, looked terrible, immediately forgotten. MODOK should’ve been saved for a better story. 

I almost was gonna turn around my thoughts at the very end when I saw it was potentially ending with a unique story for the next film to solve. But then, plot armor kicked in and then that issue was solved incredibly easily and the film ended in a completely normal way. 

I was generally ok with the Phase 4 MCU films, and strongly mixed on the MCU tv series. If the rest of the MCU will be this quality, I’m going to quit the ride.

2023-05-23,Werewolf by Night,2022,https://boxd.it/4hunON,4,,"Dear MCU - please make more content like this! 

What a breath of fresh air amongst all the MCU cookie cutter content. 

Personally, the type of franchise I want is one where each project has different genres. The closest we’ve really gotten is Alien (sci-fi horror) and Aliens (sci-fi thriller), and then the rest of the entries sorta derailed. Another version is the Cloverfield franchise (until The Cloverfield Paradox) derailed it. Other than that, every major franchise has the same type of content within it. 

Werewolf by Night is very different from the rest of the MCU. Apart from the credits, you could tell me this wasn’t the MCU and I would’ve believed you. I mean this totally as a compliment. Any non-superhero fan would appreciate this. 

Every character in this film is brand new, but I genuinely cared about all of them. I didn’t even feel this way about other MCU properties that had multiple films or episodes of time to buy me over. 

The acting is on point. People being scared didn’t seem like theatrical overacting, but that they were acting as anyone naturally would when the see a monster! 
In addition, this film has more gore than other MCU content. I mean this in a good way - things actually seemed scary enough to describe it as a true horror movie. 

I really like that this was filmed as a black-and-white, old theater cinematography. Ultimately I don’t know if there was a larger thematic reason for the choice, but I still like the choice. 

My main criticism is I wish this was an actual movie length with a theater release. They struck gold with the characters, actors, and tone here. They should’ve leaned into this more to retain MCU audiences that are losing interest. This could’ve been a monster hunt game filmed in real-time. Anyone would’ve been thrilled by this. It’s a shame that the lower quality properties got hours worth of content in films and tv series, while this one didn’t even get one hour.

2023-05-24,Pitch Perfect,2012,https://boxd.it/4hyeQt,4.5,,"This is my guilty pleasure. No judgment please!

Sidebar- I almost marked this one as a rewatch because I thought I definitely saw this trilogy before. But I totally didn’t - I’ve just seen random clips on YouTube. So once I started this film and realized I had no idea about basic plot elements (e.g. Anna Kendrick’s character is a DJ), I then realized I never actually watched this franchise. That was a funny realization. 

I think what makes me rank this higher than normal is two things:
1) I have a soft spot for anything acapella. 
2) All the characters are just weird enough to work well together. 

I’m definitely gonna enjoy throwing this on the tv every so often when I want a reliable smile. 

Two things that prevent me from ranking this perfect:
1) I go back and forth on if the inappropriate humor actually gels well with this film. On one side, they are in college so of course it happens. And if this was just an acapella drama rather than mainly a comedy, I doubt it would’ve been as popular. On the other hand, there are definitely moments where jokes go one too many. 
2) Some story elements could’ve been a little more fleshed out. For example, there is a character that has a case of puking. The movie makes you expect that eventually there’s an explanation for the puking (e.g. she pukes when she’s really stressed), but it never actually explains it.",,2023-05-21
2023-05-24,A Man Called Otto,2022,https://boxd.it/4hM3xj,4,,"A unique feel-good film with a solid Tom Hanks performance!

Tom Hanks has been a top actor since he was young. A lot of actors with a strong filmography tend to stop caring in their later years. I’m so happy that Tom Hanks still cares about his performance even in his later years. He could be an immature kid in <i>Big</i>, and now be a grumpy crank in <i>A Man Called Otto </i>and seem flawless in both. 

Despite the main character being a grumpy crank, this film can be enjoyable by all ages. Anyone can understand why he is grumpy, but also anyone can wish he could lighten up. He’s not hateful at heart and clearly doesn’t hate people for no reason - this is important to keep rooting for his betterment. 

Mariana Treviño’s performance also elevated this film for me. She acts exactly like what a caring neighbor would do in the situation. 

Sure, this follows the plot points you expect. But these type of films are not meant to surprise you. It’s about the journey you take with them. You will smile and cry at all the right moments. 

My main criticism is that certain conveniences took place near the end to tie things up into a perfect bow. I slightly wish that more effort went into meeting these story beats. It didn’t take away from my emotions with the film though, so not major for me.",,2023-05-21
2023-05-24,Till,2022,https://boxd.it/4hM8rv,5,,"An absolute gut-wrenching film. 

My historical background was knowing Emmett Till was lynched, had an open casket funeral to show the disgusting nature of lynching, and this being an important step towards civil rights justice. 

Somehow it didn’t hit me how young Emmett Till was until seeing this film. He was just a kid. Literally only 14 years old. No matter how you look at it, absolutely did not deserve this fate. And this happened in 1955 - not at all long ago. I know people today that were alive at that time. I’m thankful how far society progressed since that time, but still shocking that this happened relatively recently. 

Danielle Deadwyler as Mamie was absolutely amazing. Any mother or anyone close to their mother will connect to this performance. She is a hero for pushing for justice for Emmett despite every reason fighting against her. The film does a great job of showing the difficulties and how she fights through them.
Absolute robbery that Danielle Deadwyler got no major acting wins (or even nominations). 

The film focuses on all the right parts of this story. We see the state of Emmett Till post-murder, just like how everyone else saw the open-casket funeral. We see the gross tactics the opposing side does to win the trial. We see how all sides of the media react to the news. All this makes us feel like we were a fly on the wall in 1955 witnessing these events, and makes us angrier knowing the outcome doesn’t go the proper way.

Steven Spielberg is undoubtedly my favorite director - he basically created the modern day blockbuster, and has made the best of all genres. I admittedly haven’t watched all of his filmography (nor do I love every film of his I watched), but I walk away from each film with strong respect to Spielberg. 

A part of me feels bad to give any criticisms to this film because it’s obviously a personal semi-autobiography of Spielberg. But, I must be honest with sharing the pros and cons of any film I watch. 

My favorite moments are everything involving Sammy’s work with filmmaking. 
We witness the exact moment when he falls in love with film from that theater experience. While any other person would probably talk on about their favorite scenes, Sammy actually acted upon it by trying to recreate how that was possible to capture on film. Anyone that is passionate about their hobby likely had a similar event in their life and will strongly relate to this introduction. 
It’s admirable to also see that in his teenage years he also excelled in filmmaking. He definitely didn’t know the basics of switching film reels and editing, but his passion gave the motivation to figure it out. He gave a passionate speech to an older actor to bring out the emotion into the final shot. He hosted viewing parties for all his family and friends, and they all loved his work. This is motivation goals that all of us should try to imitate. 
My favorite scene was how his father, a super smart scientist, didn’t know how Sammy captured the gunshots on film. When Sammy explained that he made holes in the film reel - I myself was mindblown too. This outside the box thinking is clearly what made Spielberg a strong director in his time. 

Sidebar - the film nerd in me was very invested in how filmmaking worked back in the day. Now, you can just have smartphones to take videos and apps for editing. But back then, proper cameras and manual film reels were required. A much bigger hinderence to get into filmmaking, so extra kudos for all the older filmmakers for working through all that!

The parts that didn’t work for me <i>as well</i> were the family dynamics (again, I hate to critique this since it is based on his actual family). I’m not at all against including family dynamics - they can be a huge part in the motivations or detriments of people pursuing their passion. There were parts that felt very unique - Sammy learning about a family update through his past film reels. Sammy imagining himself filming a family fight. The struggles he faced after a move, and how film brought him back to happiness. Basically, anything that directly related to Sammy filmmaking worked well for me. All other family dynamic moments felt like a totally different movie.",,2023-05-25

The main thing for me was that it’s much longer than it needs to be - there are many scenes that could have been about half the time. So it felt like a chore to sit through it. 

Cate Blanchett was definitely good - personally I didn’t feel she was interstellar like all the reviews though. I definitely would’ve replaced Danielle Deadwyler from Till with her for the Academy Award nomination. 

When a main character is more on the immoral side, it can be difficult for a film to make you actually be invested into the character. One of the few that worked for me is Adam Sandler in Uncut Gems - he played a terrible human being, but I was so invested in the story that I still cared about how Adam Sandler would navigate this. On the other hand, I unfortunately didn’t care enough about the story to be invested in Cate Blanchett’s sorta immoral character. 

I watched a fair amount of reviews around this film - there admittedly is a lot of depth that I didn’t pick up on during my watch. Once I learned this, I gained some more admiration for the film.

This film is a sequel to a spin-off of a franchise that undoubtedly got more films than it should’ve. On paper, this shouldn’t be a critically acclaimed film. But somehow, this actually works so well!

First off, Puss in Boots’ character arc is super investing. It makes sense both within this film and when you take the other films’ backstory into account. 
His villain character (called the simple name “Death” but I promise actually has a lot more to him) is actually a great character to further explore Puss in Boots. To the point that I think Death is one of the scariest villains I’ve seen in film. 

Every side character also had a deep backstory and their own character arcs. Even Perrito, the comic relief side character! There’s a specific scene between Puss in Boots and Perrito that almost made me tear up, knowing the relationship my brother’s dog has with our family. 

The first Shrek films had a freshness because they took fairy tale characters and took them in other fun directions. This film did the same with Goldilocks and the three bears. In a way this is actually a smart choice because these are known characters so the film doesn’t need to spend as much time explaining who they are. So this film even paid proper homage to the first Shrek films!

And of course, the unique animation! It was a huge risk to deviate from the normal animation of the Shrek franchise. I expected this animation style to feel like a copy of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. But, this animation is not at all a copy - it took some inspiration, but also morphed it with the animation of the rest of the Shrek franchise. 

My only criticism is with the villain character of Jack Horner. He was by no means bad - in fact, he had a lot of great lines and would’ve been totally serviceable in any everyday film. But, I felt his character didn’t have as much of a depth as everyone else.

However, this style elevated the film for me. While the story was great and unique, I was somehow more invested in the style than the story. I could’ve paid zero attention to the story and still enjoy everything about it. 

I’m also now much more invested in the filmography of Ralph Fiennes. I first obviously witnessed him as Voldemort. Then after <i>The Menu </i>and now this film, I bet he has a wild range of performances to explore. 

The only criticism I have is that this film is basically someone telling a story of someone telling a story about the misadventures of this concierge. This background ended up not really having a reason. I wish this was just straight up about the misadventures of this concierge.

I haven’t seen any of Scott Derrickson’s films before <i>Doctor Strange</i>, so I looked forward to see what he would do in his own root element without the studio interference of the MCU. If his other films are like this, then I definitely look forward to checking them out. (I also wish we could see his version on the sequel to <i>Doctor Strange</i> because I really did not like what we actually got)

Admittedly, horror is my least favorite genre. I didn’t watch horror films until adulthood, so I don’t have a nostalgic connection to them. In addition, mainstream horror can go into supernatural elements, which takes me away from believability. I would never completely shut out a film over its genre (and more people need to have that mindset), but it will take more from me to actually like a horror film. 
I’m thankful that the only supernatural element in this film is the black phone schtick. Since the entire premise of the film was around this black phone, I could still feel invested in the film. 

My favorite part of the film is the brother/sister relationship between the kids. I rarely witness films with a close sibling relationship - they usually involve fighting, or the film focuses more on other relationships. This sibling relationship actually felt real and close. When the brother is missing, we feel emotional about it through the sister’s response. Most kidnapping films would’ve focused on the parent’s reactions, so I appreciated this change. 

I also like that this film takes place in the 1970s. It genuinely feels like we are in that timeframe as we are watching. 

Overall, it followed all the right beats. Well acted, didn’t jump the shark, stayed thrilling through the runtime. It did what it needed to do. Not amazing enough to rave about, but I’d definitely recommend a one time watch.

Die Hard with David Harbour as Santa. This premise should just write itself. I should’ve loved everything about this. Unfortunately, the more I was watching, the more frustrating I got at the choices this film made. 

Is this a film for kids? Is this a film for adults? Is this a vulgar, gorey film? Is this a comedy? Is this a heartfelt Christmas film? It feels like the filmmakers tried to say “yes” to all of the above, rather than committing to one of them. 

I just couldn’t get over the various inconsistencies in this film. For example, a father tells his daughter that Santa isn’t real and that her parents bought all her Christmas gifts. Soon after, Santa shared that he gave this child toys a couple years prior. How is that supposed to be possible? How could we let things like that slide?

There are also a lot of plot armor elements. Santa’s magic works and doesn’t work when the plot needs it to happen. All Home Alone homages are suddenly stitched together into one scene. 

Other than Santa and the kid, none of the characters are likable at all. Even the hostages. You need to like the hostages if you want us to care about their safety. 

There were also a lot of dimly lit scenes that made it hard to parse what was happening. 

Keeping one star because David Harbour as Santa is perfect casting and there are heartfelt moments between him and the kid. Other than that, nothing is redeemable here.

2023-06-07,Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,2023,https://boxd.it/4lnBnj,5,,"So much hype from start to finish. 

My background with this franchise is pretty interesting. When I first heard that they were making an animated Spider-Man movie, I was frustrated. We had the Raimi trilogy that I enjoyed, then the Amazing Spider-Man films that I didn’t like (although I appreciated Andrew Garfield), and then finally we got Spider-Man into the MCU. And I really liked Tom Holland as Spider-Man. I really didn’t want more iterations of Spider-Man, and wished we could just let the MCU Spider-Man shine. 2018 was also interesting because we got Venom which I didn’t like (especially because this also meant Venom wouldn’t be in the MCU). And specific to the <i>Into the Spider-Verse </i>trailers, I really didn’t get it - is it just redoing Spider-Man but without Peter Parker as the lead?
Once I heard <i>Into the Spider-Verse </i>was actually getting stellar reviews, I was shocked. I watched it in theaters - I definitely laughed, but overall I felt down the middle. Wasn’t disappointed, but also wasn’t mindblown. 
I then watched this movie again on Netflix couple months later - that’s when I fell in love with the film. I think I didn’t like it initially because I kept thinking about how I didn’t want more Spider-Man reboots, and didn’t stop to just appreciate the unique art and emotional depth. 

As much as I would give the first film a 5/5, I actually wasn’t super excited about <i>Across the Spider-Verse </i>as much as other films coming out this year. I was skeptical about the sequel actually feeling fresh compared to the original. 

From the first scene, it was clear that this film was going to be iconic. The art style is absolutely beautiful. In a similar and completely different manner than <i>Dune</i>, every shot of this film can be blown up into a beautiful art piece. There are altering art styles that somehow work perfectly. It also genuinely feels like reading a comic book. 5 years after the first film, it’s clear that a lot of love went into the art and that is so appreciated. 

There are so many characters in this film, but each and every one of them are well realized. I clearly understood each of their motivations, and why they do the actions that they do. 

I also enjoyed the multiverse aspect of this film. I actually want to explore this multiverse further (as opposed to what we got in <i>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</i>). It explains well how every world with Spider-Man follows similar tropes but each world has a unique flavor as well. 

Above all else, the story was super investing. I was just on the ride the whole time and felt the surprising twists at all the right moments. I nearly teared up at all the emotional beats. 

I appreciate that this film will provide enjoyment even upon rewatches. The pace is so fast, which keeps you on your feet the whole time. However, I’m sure there are details I missed that I will observe on another rewatch. 

Yes, this film ends abruptly to set up the next film (another interesting comparison to <i>Dune</i>). I know a lot of people will hate this. My personal view is that as long as the current film was an enjoyable journey, I don’t care about it only being a “Part 1”. And I absolutely enjoyed this journey. I just hope it ends well (and I trust the creative team to do this). 

The theater I watched the film at was handing out free posters for the film to everyone. Never saw that before. Definitely increased my enjoyment in this theater experience.",,2023-06-02

I generally rate films higher than I should if it takes a risky and unique approach and doesn’t execute it terribly. I don’t expect this film to work for most people, but it worked well enough for me. 

75% of the film is Idris Elba as a Djinn reciting his years of life story to Tilda Swinton, while 25% of the film is about Tilda Swinton’s life. Most critics seemed to like the 25% part and hate the 75% part. I’m the opposite - I liked the 75% part and was bored by the 25% part. 
I could watch Idris Elba’s Djinn narrate his life story for hours. Usually, narration reduces the impact of scenes. But, Idris Elba’s delivery juxtaposed with the randomest life events was super amusing to me. If they were instead normal scenes with normal dialogue, I don’t think I would’ve been as invested. I didn’t need connective tissue or a “so what” to all this - I’d be blindly along the journey. It reminded me of those <i>Cars </i>shorts where Mater recites moments of his past life to Lightning McQueen.

The characters and the acapella really elevate this franchise for me above other similar genre films. 

All the side characters are basically just described by their one trait, and jokes for that trait get reused through the runtime. Personally, I felt they were all well-timed and well-delivered jokes so I didn’t mind it. They <i>almost </i>got to an overused amount though - I understand if it tipped to overused levels for others though. 

In the first film, I acknowledged that there were some subplots that didn’t get fully realized, but it didn’t affect my appreciation for the film. However, it did affect me for this film. For example, there’s a subplot Anna Kendrick trying to pursue a music producer future with Keegan Michael-Key (who was hilarious by the way). It had interesting aspects, but it wasn’t cleanly executed with the overall story.

2023-06-12,Rocky Balboa,2006,https://boxd.it/4mylGF,3.5,,"Another solid film in the franchise!

Kudos to Sylvester Stallone for making 6 movies in the franchise thus far, with each them feeling some level of justification.  Each one has had a unique enough aspect worth exploring with another film. 

This portrayed in a realistic manner where a successful athlete would be at age 60. Retired. Owning a business. Depressed over the loss of a loved one. 

In particular, I really liked the portrayal of nepotism effects with his son - the son is distant because he wants to not live in his father’s shadow anymore but can’t escape it. This brought my favorite scene, when Rocky gives a speech to him about how he should fight through it. It was delivered very consistently with Rocky’s character type too. 

Killing off the character of Adrian is risky, but it actually turned out very well here. It led to exploring the sadness of Rocky, and then his rejuvenation when he is ultimately back into boxing. 
I’m also very happy with the characterization of Marie. She easily could’ve just been the next love interest for Rocky, but thankfully they didn’t go that path. They stayed as a platonic relationship where both sides had something to gain from it, and kept the honor of Adrian through it all. Opposite gender roles in films almost always are romantic, so kudos to this film for going a different route. 

Seeing this film in 2023 made the computer aspect super hilarious. “If an athlete from the past fought against an athlete from the present, who would win?” is undoubtedly a ChatGPT question. And version 6 of ChatGPT will likely produce a play-by-play visual of this fake fight. 

Without spoilers - apparently another cut of this film had the end result of the fight go in the opposite direction, and it actually ended with the same reaction from Rocky. That makes perfect sense, since Rocky’s motivation here is very different from prior films. 

The main part that really set this back for me was the direction of the final fight. It felt like they just had a shot of every default filter available in the video editing system and used it. The best part of the past fights were that it felt like we were watching real people doing real fighting. Here, it felt so dramatized and took away all tension for me. 

Another minor setback for me was the character of Paulie. He was never my favorite in the franchise. But here, his inclusion felt very inconsistent and took away from the other strong aspects of the film. 

It seems this film was really praised at the time of its release because of the big gap between films (especially when people thought Rocky V is the last film) and that Stallone’s career really stagnated around this time so Rocky and Stallone followed similar character arcs. I totally understand that, but years later new fans of the franchise may not have this impact to elevate their feelings. Not really a pro or con here, but felt it was worth acknowledging.",,2023-06-10
2023-06-12,Freaky,2020,https://boxd.it/4mH8XL,3,,"Amazing premise, frustrating execution (no pun intended)

I was ready to give this a 5/5. A slasher with a body-swapping schtick is a hilarious concept, and Vince Vaughn and Kathryn Newton are perfect casting as the serial killer and high school student. Unfortunately, too many inconsistencies kept pulling me away. I began the film about to give a 5/5, and then I ended the film with just barely recommending it.

The opening film is actually very creepy - A+ introduction. The rest of the film ends up being a less serious tone. While initially feeling odd, this does make sense. A serial killer & high school student getting a body-swap will obviously not keep this serious of a tone.

The part they really nailed are the performances of Vince Vaughn and Kathryn Newton. Vince Vaughn can appear creepy, and also acts very well as a teenage girl. Kathryn Newton looks perfect as a teenage girl, and plays well with how a serial killer would act as her body. As expected, they utilize the Vince Vaughn body as a fear and Kathryn Newton as a seemingly innocent person well.

Obviously films will have coincidences happen, but there were so many here to the point of unbelievability. I started getting turned off when the woodshop high school teacher straight up acts like an asshole to Kathryn Newton, to the point where that woodshop teacher should get fired for his actions. 
The point that I lost it is soon after the body-swap happens. Kathryn Newton was set up as someone that doesn't put effort into her looks. But post body-swap, she ties her hair in a perfect ponytail and has model-level makeup and lipstick on. Would a Vince Vaughn type actually know how to put handle cosmetics??
If these were the only coincidences, I could ignore it. But, there's a new coincidence happening every 5 minutes so that made it hard to believe.

Totally unrelated to my review - Kathryn Newton's character is a super fan of Pitch Perfect 2 and has a poster of it in her bedroom. I just recently watched Pitch Perfect 2...",,2023-06-11
2023-06-15,The Peanut Butter Falcon,2019,https://boxd.it/4nmOD1,4,,"A feel-good film with a couple great scenes and incredible performance from Zack Gottsagen. 

The best part of this is how the character of Zak, a person with Down Syndrome, is handled. It’s the perfect combination of acknowledging he has a disability, while also not treating him with pity. We understand why he wants freedom, but we also obviously know that the world will be tough for him and want to protect him. How do we handle this? The film nicely shows how to do this. 
Zak’s happiness is truly infectious. Anytime he is happy, everyone will be happy. 

Tyler and Zak’s chemistry is also charming. Tyler is obviously a flawed person, but his behavior towards Zak is heartwarming. He treats Zak like a normal person, but will defend him against the world’s attacks. 

There’s a lot of conveniences to make this story go it’s directions. (We just accept that Eleanor knocks on the same doors as Tyler soon after?). But unlike my prior watched film <i>Freaky</i>, the conveniences didn’t take away from the intended feelings with the film. It does prevent me from raving about it though. 

I also would’ve liked to see more about the backstory of Tyler. The film shows moments of flashbacks, and makes us make assumptions on how those moments resolve and result in the Tyler we see on film. But, actually showing the resolution of those moments would’ve been powerful.",,2023-06-12

One thing I generally applaud with this series is that the quality is consistent through all three films. Each one has great one-liners, and each one also has sequences that go a couple lines longer than it should. I think there is a 5/5 star version of an Austin Powers film that has aspects of all three films. This version would focus more on smart humor and less on raunchy humor. 

Yes, definitely many moments that don’t age well. I wouldn’t mark this against the film, but I would add this as a caution before having a newbie watch something in this series.

It’s really frustrating that the filmmakers were given a giant budget to make <i>Ramayana </i>with modern visual effects, but deviated so much from the source material. 
I briefly read through production details to try to understand what they were going for. Did they try to adapt <i>Ramayana </i>but decided to add some creative additions to be different? Or did they want a different story with inspiration from <i>Ramayana</i>? It seems that “Yes” was answered to both questions at different points, and that really showed in the film. Committing to either direction would’ve let me move this rating to the positive direction. But the inconsistencies were too apparent. 

Very odd choice to not call any of the characters by their known names. It’s not Ram and Sita, but Raghava and Janaki. Same goes for every character here. Literally no reason to do this. 

The vibe of this world is also frustrating. The whole setting was darkly lit with dark colors (other than one scene). <i>Ramayana </i>is supposed to have a bright and positive feel (even if battles exist). 
Then, Sri Lanka for some reason was visualized with a Gotham-like feel. Completely opposite setting to the jungle vibe of India. It truly felt like I was watching two different movies. 

All of the above was my commentary on the frustrations around deviations from the source material. But even with the lens of not knowing the source material, there’s a lot wrong here. 

I usually don’t comment on bad acting, but Prabhas was horribly miscast here. He had an emotionless state the entire time and no charisma. All the inspiration to feel in this film depends on him as the leader, and he did not deliver. 

There was a huge reliance on showing off CGI. While I understand that Indian film CGI is nowhere near on the level as American film CGI, the focus should’ve moved towards character development than on visuals. 

Not many positives but I’ll list them:
- The score is good, even if it is overplayed a lot. 
- I would love to see Saif Ali Khan as a super villain character in a comic book film someday. His villain performance here was better than many supervillains I’ve seen recently. (Unfortunately, it was nothing like Ravana so that frustrated me)
- 3 hour runtime, but it didn’t totally feel that long. I didn’t really have the urge to check the time or truly feel it’s length.

This film really makes you a fly on the wall through the brutality that existed in this time. Can’t believe how disgusting slave-owners acted, and how they treated slaves as property and not people. 
The scenes that really hurt me are the ones where technically brutality could stop if someone just got up and said something. But, all the slave-owners don’t view it as brutality and all the slaves had rightful fear to speak up. I really wished I could jump into the film and stop the madness that I was witnessing. 

Excellent performances from Michael Fassbender, Chiwetel Ejifor, and Lupita Nyongo (amongst others). They really elevated the film. 

I remember wishing that <i>The Wolf of Wall Street </i>won the Best Picture Oscar this year. But after seeing this film, I’m not at all mad about this winning. Very well deserved. Also well deserved Oscar for Lupita Nyongo’s performance and the adapted screenplay. 

Dropping a half star for a couple nitpicks. 
Namely, it felt like the passage of time was much less than 12 years. 
Also, as our main character moved around plantations, there would be some moments that didn’t seem to amount to much.

The only Wes Anderson film I saw other than this one is <i>The Grand Budapest Hotel</i>. I don’t know why it took so long for me to start watching his films, because he’s so in line with my guilty pleasures. The vibe is always so goofy and dysfunctional. I don’t need to watch his films with a close studying eye (even if there is a lot to analyze) because I can just relax and enjoy the journey, while at the same time I really shouldn’t multitask while watching his films in case I miss a great one-liner. 
Another thing I noticed that I love about his films is despite there being A-listers, each actor truly encompasses a character in the Wes Anderson world. So I see the film more as a goofy film than the actors playing their characters. 

On rom-com standards, this stands out above the rest by a mile. First off, I fully understood why the main characters wanted to leave their lives to be together. Most rom-coms don’t put focus on why you should believe the leads should be together (other than they are the main characters and are attractive). The leads here had a lot of pain in their lives, and found solace in each other through that terrible pain. So even though they did a sorta immature task of running away, I rooted for them. Also, unlike other rom-come, this followed none of the formulaic beats. 

This world seems like such fun to pursue further. I’d be more than happy to watch more content from this world. The island vibe brings beautiful shots, and all the groups of people (especially the scouts) are very charming.

This one is very different from this list. There isn’t really a cohesive story or the typical Tarantino-style way with words.

It’s interesting to compare this film with Spielberg’s <i>The Fabelmans</i>. Both are love letters to film made by great movie directors that are near the end of their careers.

An interesting question is posed: would you kill a loved one to <i>potentially </i>save the rest of the world? I’d love to watch a film that just explores this question. Unfortunately the film decides to not focus on this question much.

In most M. Night films (even the ones I’d give a positive review), I feel like the dialogue is trash. People don’t talk naturally in his films, they talk with no emotion and state common knowledge facts. I don’t know why he keeps getting away with this. But at least for this film, the trash dialogue didn’t actually get to my nerves. Everyone generally acted as how anyone would in the same situation.

2023-07-03,Extraction 2,2023,https://boxd.it/4sz1bD,4.5,,"A non-stop thrill with excellent action sequences and solid performance from Chris Hemsworth.

I admittedly don't remember much from the first film. All I remember is that it had a cool one-shot action sequence and it overall just good enough for me watch it until the end. This sequel is much better than the original, and I can't wait for a third film (which hopefully gets a deserved theatrical release).

The action sequences here are top notch. I have no idea how any of these were filmed. Huge kudos to Sam Hargrave for bringing his best craft forward. I watched each sequence feeling breathless, as exhausted as the characters (even though they were obviously doing much more than a useless viewer like me). 
Amongst every other reason, the first prison break sequence was particularly amazing. 2 things here stood out to me. First, the inclusion of Mia's character in the fight was fascinating - juxtaposed with Chris Hemsworth's Tyler Rake kicking as much ass as he can was Mia fighting in the way that an everyday 40-year-old would fight. Second, there was also a teenage angst experience juxtaposed through crazy action that correctly elevated the stressful tension.
The craziness in all the action sequences, in my opinion, were just at the barrier between ""this is mindblowingly amazing"" to ""this would never actually happen in real life"". It was only one bullet wound that took me briefly out of believability, but I'll let that slide since it was only one moment.

I'm so proud with Chris Hemsworth's performance here. I feel like he hasn't gotten a true spotlight. He was perfectly cast in the Thor films and he clearly gave his all in both action and comedic moments, but Thor's characterization through the MCU was unfortunately very inconsistent. And Chris Hemsworth's other films seem to have not stuck well enough to give him a proper legacy. But his performance in this film is amazing. I'd put this performance on the level of other charismatic actors that are willing to do their own stunts, like Tom Cruise and Keanu Reaves. 

Also, great action stuntwork and acting from Golshifteh Farahani. I don't recall seeing her in other films, but I can't wait to see more.

Many reviews seem to criticize this film for only being strong in action and not making an investing screenplay. I highly disagree with this. It's slightly formulaic and slightly predictable plot-wise, but it was executed so well that it shouldn't be a criticism. As giant as the set-pieces are, it is kept very small scale as it is basically an elevated family disagreement (with minions regrettably involved too). This was the correct choice - overcomplications like international politics would've taken away from the strengths this film has to offer.
In fact, there was a unique plot point here that I thought made this film not only investing but also believable. A certain character's choices could've easily come off as a dumb action required to propel the story forward, but his backstory very clearly showed why his character would make these dumb choices. 

There was a fun Thor-related cameo that I won't spoil. In the back of my head, I really wanted this character to be explored better in the Thor films. But, I'm glad that at least these actors are sharing the moments I wanted in the Extraction franchise.

I had to spend three days to sit with my thoughts to finally put something out there. Even then, I’m sure my ranking would change if I ever watch this again. 

For now, my finally ranking is sadly not a positive one. I really wanted to root for this movie for various reasons, but at the end it’s hard for me to root for it. I have to review this just by the movie alone, and not let the film production history slide me a certain way. 

Looking strictly at just what is on screen: everything is aggressively fine. The acting is fine. The CGI is fine. The story is fine. It’s not boring even though it’s a slightly higher runtime. For everything that this film does, a better version of it exists in other films. So there’s really no reason to spend the time on this. 
The only way I could see some worth is maybe if this film was seen in theaters. I could see this having similar effect to <i>Avatar</i> - absolutely beautiful in theaters, but all visual magic is lost when seen on a TV. 

Now here’s everything I have to say in regards to everything outside of the screen: there should be a movie just about all the attempts on making this movie. It’s fascinating. 
First of all, the fact that the source material is a book collection that literally influenced the greatest sci-fi properties (e.g. <i>Star Wars</i>, <i>Avatar</i>, <i>Dune</i>). At the same time, this is property is really not well known. I’ve literally never heard of <i>A Princess of Mars</i>, and I feel like I should if it caused so much influence. It feels like salt on the wound to view this film as derivative of many others, when the “many others” are technically derivative of this film’s source material. 
Next, attempts to create this source material into a film are so interesting. To think that this was almost the first animated film made by Walt Disney instead of <i>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs… </i>just imagine that alternate reality. If that was executed well, <i>Star Wars </i>would not have its magic. Another interesting alternate reality is if this was directed by John McTiernan (director of <i>Die Hard </i>and <i>Predator</i>, amongst others) with Tom Cruise as the lead actor. That would’ve undoubtedly been a box office hit by a long mile. And John McTiernan denied it because at the time he didn’t believe that the technology existed to turn that vision into a reality. 
Finally, we get to the production that created what we got. Andrew Stanton as the director is very interesting - his past films were Pixar films. Brad Bird went from Pixar to <i>Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol</i>, so there is precedent for a first time live-action director absolutely killing it. I have a lot of respect for not casting A-list actors because it allows us to just immerse in the world and not focus on familiar faces. On the flip side, I can’t believe how high this budget was without A-list actors. And on top of that, the studio decided to not care about marketing this film and instead focus on making the Lucasfilm purchase work out (in hindsight, I highly question if that was a worthy purchase given the products that Disney generated). This film had the most generic title ever for a grand sci-fi film. Somehow they decided to remove <i>A Princess of Mars</i> as the title so as to not alienate male audiences…and then chose to title it with a generic white name. Why?

I just feel really bad for everyone that spent the time to make this film. They all clearly put great effort into it. And even if the product isn’t amazing, it still deserved much better love and legacy than it ended up getting.

I’m also gonna throw in another tangent. Many people hate that Disney does a bunch of live-action remakes rather than original content. Why does Disney do this? Look at the box-office returns of their recent live-action work. The remakes (e.g. <i>Beauty and the Beast</i>, <i>The Lion King</i>, <i>Aladdin</i>) have averaged billions of dollars in returns. The original work (e.g. <i>The Lone Ranger</i>, <i>Jungle Cruise</i>, <i>John Carter</i>) have all flopped. There is always original content out there, it’s up to you to support it in theaters. If we don’t reward originality, we won’t obtain more originality.",,2023-07-03
2023-07-09,Hotel Artemis,2018,https://boxd.it/4uujd1,3,,"Great premise, ok execution. 

I’m totally in love with the concept of this film. Yes, the idea of criminals checking into a hotel already exists with the <i>John Wick</i> franchise. But, what makes this film’s concept still feel fresh is that the whole film takes place within the hotel. So it feels a lot more contained. 

The world of this film is pretty intriguing. There are many films that take place in a dirty and riot-filled LA setting (e.g. <i>Blade Runner</i>, <i>Predator 2</i>) but this one still has it’s own flavor for both the city and hotel. If this film was more amazingly executed, this would’ve been really interesting to explore further in sequels. 

Great cast and performances across the board. Standouts are Jodie Foster and Dave Bautista and Sofia Boutella. Again, would’ve been interested to explore them further in a franchise. 

The main problem is that many great ideas are thrown out there, but none really have payoff. For example, the film starts with an issue where water is privatized and people in the city riot. But by the time I get to the end of the film, this plot point didn’t really matter.  

The performances and the world of the film are enough for me to give a positive recommendation, but don’t have high expectations.",,2023-07-06
2023-07-12,American Graffiti,1973,https://boxd.it/4vrfRJ,2.5,,"I watched this to complete the collection of films directed by George Lucas. While I admittedly am not the biggest fan of his other films, I have huge respect for him as a visionary. For example, I’m not in love with the <i>Star Wars </i>films but I love the <i>Star Wars </i>universe. Since his other films were sci-fi, I was intrigued by how a film in a totally different genre would be. 

My overall thoughts are that this film is definitely very competently made, but it’s not the film for me. I know what really catapulted this film as a cult following was that it came out at the perfect time for its target audience. It came out in the 70s and it gave nostalgia to people that were teenagers in the 60s. The film involved random debauchery like robbing coins from an arcade, which I just don’t relate to. If a version of this film came out today but for the 2010s, I’m sure it would involve random debauchery like stealing phones to post dumb things on Facebook, and I’d have much more of a connection to it. 

What was interesting about this film was that it was sorta more like a “hangout” movie. It was a bunch of vignettes with seemingly no purpose or plot development, but just made to enjoy the ride. This is a risky direction because it can lead to audiences saying “so what?” to the film. I think this direction is fine if the journey speaks well to you, but it just didn’t relate much to me. 

While I didn’t give this a positive review, I am glad a movie like this exists in the filmography of George Lucas. His work in <i>Star Wars </i>and <i>Indians Jones </i>is commendable, but I do wish he explored this other side of him more. 
The <i>Star Wars </i>prequels are shamed on, and one of the many constructive criticisms people tend to have is that the studio should have been more involved to prevent weird choices like Jar Jar Binks. I generally agree with that constructive criticism. But, I think there could’ve been opportunities for him to explore ~$30 million budget non-IP films with full creative control. Some of them could have struck gold, and George Lucas definitely would be able to look back on his work with more happiness.",,2023-07-09
2023-07-13,Sully,2016,https://boxd.it/4vEzD9,4.5,,"Full disclosure: I’m probably biased on the positive end here because I’m super fascinated by the “Miracle on the Hudson” story. I remember watching the news story back in 2009 and feeling so happy - positive outcomes to flight disasters are rare, and the quick thinking of the pilot and everyone else was so admirable. 
Also, this is probably the first film about a true story where I actually sorta experienced the true story back when it happened. 

This film easily could’ve just been a retelling of the events. But, it took risks to be different and I feel it paid off well. For example, the film starts after the plane landing, and we see the plane landing event through flashbacks. This brought good perspective from the NTSB end on why they grilled the way they did. 
In addition, the film easily could’ve made the scope feel super cinematic with grand patriotic vibes. But, they filmed everything in a modest and subdued manner. This was the right call for many reasons. First, this made it much more realistic and felt like we were actually there. Also, this is very in line with the personality of Sully. I’m so happy that despite casting a huge star like Tom Hanks, the performance stayed super faithful to Sully’s vibe. I almost forgot I was seeing the face of Tom Hanks. 

The flaw I have though, is in how they showed the NTSB in the later half. I understand that historic films can sometimes take creative liberties to change the real story - I’m fine with it in places like <i>The Social Network </i>if it truly is a choice that pays off. But here, I don’t see the reason why the NTSB were portrayed as antagonists when that’s not really what happened. The reasons they were skeptical in the film didn’t make sense and I wouldn’t expect real NTSB employees to behave that way. Rather than focusing on the NTSB trials, I would’ve preferred that they focused on Sully’s internal PTSD thoughts on if he really did make the right call. That would’ve not only been a much more interesting concept, but it is realistic too.",,2023-07-11
2023-07-15,Creed,2015,https://boxd.it/4w3XcB,4.5,Yes,"I watched this film for the first time in theaters, without watching any of the prior Rocky films. I remember still enjoying it a lot. I remember appreciating the cinematography balanced with emotional weight of characters that I surprisingly cared about. So I was obviously very excited to relive this again after watching all the prior Rocky films. 

The best praise I can give this film is that it balanced nostalgia with freshness perfectly. This is why I could enjoy it on my first watch without knowing the history. This film is equally about Rocky Balboa and Adonis Creed. Rocky’s characterization is consistent with the prior films, as well as Adonis Creed with the related characters we know from the prior films. 
This film easily could’ve just leaned into fan service, but it smartly didn’t. For example, It could’ve played the classic Rocky theme song during the training montage, but it played a different song that fit Adonis for his training montage (and then left the Rocky theme song for a much better moment that I won’t spoil). These choices were very smart - as I watched the film I’d tell myself “dang I wish you used this callback” and then after the scene was over I’d say “actually, what we got here was the better direction”. I think this is because Ryan Coogler was involved and he wasn’t involved in the prior films. This was the right moment in the franchise to bring in a fresh voice that also actually respects its history. If <i>Top Gun: Maverick </i>didn’t exist, I’d call this the best reboot ever. 

As mentioned earlier, Rocky’s characterization was solid. I believed why he’s at the state he is at the start of the film, and why the existence of Adonis influences his decisions through the film. 

My only major flaw is that I didn’t really feel the grit of the final fight and it’s opponent. I feel like the final fight existed because “well, all Rocky films have a final fight”. But it already deviated in other ways in a smart manner, so it didn’t need to do this. 
A minor flaw is that in the middle there was a plot point about Adonis Creed’s history suddenly turning into major news, but this seemed to not really affect the main characters as much as I would’ve expected. 

Still, great film. I know Ryan Coogler has since gotten really involved in the Wakanda world of the MCU, but I hope he comes back to the smaller films like this.",,2023-07-13
2023-07-17,Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning,2023,https://boxd.it/4wXPBP,4.5,,"Nonstop quality action sequences from start to finish!

Tom Cruise, you are an absolute inspiration. You put so much effort into your craft to entertain us, and it is very clear both on and off screen. 

I had the privilege of experiencing D-Box for the first time with this film. This film format may be the only one so far that I’d be willing to regularly pay extra for this format. It really elevated this film. The car chase in Rome had many chair vibrations with enough discomfort to feel like I was in the film but not too much to feel like a gimmick. The chair waved along with skydives, which was absolutely beautiful. I was full-on sweating by the end of the film because D-Box made me feel like I was feeling Tom Cruise’s stress too. 

One thing that I really appreciate about the Mission Impossible franchise is that each film feels so different. This is largely because the first four films all have different directors. And while Christopher McQuarrie directed the next ones, he managed to each of them feel unique to each other. I can distinctly remember which plot point and set piece happened in which film despite there being seven installments. I’m glad that this film continued the uniqueness. 
(One thing I haven’t liked in McQuarrie’s films, though, is how the clips through the opening credits are scenes that will occur later in the movie. Why are you spoiling scenes in your own movie? We already paid the money to watch this in the theater, there’s no reason to show these off!)

I’ve heard some people say that the length is long and each action sequence is a bit too long. I don’t necessarily disagree, but each action sequence is such amazing quality that long length should be a praise instead of a criticism! I’m absolutely shocked that this is almost a 3 hour movie because I did not feel tired or bored or draggy at all through the runtime. 

The train sequence in particular reminded me exactly of the <i>Uncharted </i>video games. It definitely had over-the-top action moments, but kept enough believability and realisticness to keep the thrill (if only I could say the same about the actual <i>Uncharted </i>film). 

<i>Ghost Protocol </i>is probably my favorite Mission Impossible movie. It did a great job of making tension much more elevated than what the plot gave. For example, in that film the Burj Khalifa climb scene was much more stressful because the glove technology didn’t work as expected. This film brought back a lot of similar methods to elevate tension, which I really appreciated. 
<i>Ghost Protocol </i>also had a great blend of humor throughout the film. This film seemed to imitate some of that humor too. I laughed at all the right moments, but I still felt that the humor didn’t fit in as cleanly as it did in <i>Ghost Protocol</i>. 

I feel strongly mixed about the plot. On one side, I kinda sick of hearing A.I. in film because A.I. talk is all over the news and my profession these days. And in many moments, the A.I. parts felt like they were just used for plot conveniences. On the other hand, it did expose actual scary sentient fears of A.I. that could be a potential and realistic future for ourselves. 
But, there were many exposition dump scenes about how the A.I works. I would normally really criticize a movie for doing this in a blatant manner, but I’m willing to forgive this film for doing that because it meant more time for those amazing quality action set pieces. (To be honest, I really don’t care much about plots in Mission Impossible movies because I somehow still keep care for the characters and enjoy the action set pieces). 
However, what was really weird for me was that during these exposition scenes, shots of people talking would cut back in different angles. Usually for these shots, they are consistently shot back to the same angle to keep focus on the dialogue. But here, they’d cut back in a different angle each time. I don’t know why that happened because it was so distracting. 

Another nitpick negative for me was the overuse of pickpocketing. 

Lastly, I really don’t understand the marketing for this film. The motorcycle jump scene was advertised so much, and while it was great to watch it’s only a couple seconds in the actual film. Every major set piece is in some trailer. The marketing should’ve started with just been Tom Cruise talking about doing his own stunts - that would’ve been enough to get butts in theater seats and we would’ve been much more wowed by the stunts. Then about a month after release, show off more scenes in trailers. to get the stragglers into the theater. 

Overall, I do acknowledge many of the cons in this film. These cons make me prefer <i>Ghost Protocol </i>and <i>Fallout</i> over this one. But, there was so much love and care and effort put into keeping the film thrilling for me that the cons are just not a major concern for me. I hope everyone experiences this film in theaters so that we get more like it!",,2023-07-14
2023-07-22,Black Mirror: Demon 79,2023,https://boxd.it/4yykxv,3,,"A solid time-pass and a good addition to the Black Mirror world. 

My personal view of M. Night Shyamalan is that his films take on premises that are super interesting and could have potential to be a cult classic, but unfortunately have mediocre execution. I definitely felt this sentiment while watching <i>Knock at the Cabin </i>earlier this year. 

I viewed this Black Mirror episode as a much better executed premise that <i>Knock at the Cabin </i>had. I think this execution with an actual film-length runtime (and not linked to Black Mirror) would’ve made me like it more. But, the silly tone does prevent it from being cult classic potential for me. 
That being said, the banter with the demon to the protagonist was absolutely hilarious. No way would an actual being scared of the apocalypse joke around, but the quips landed very well. 

I felt strongly average about how things eventually resolved. I think it generally made sense and was consistent though. 

The main thing that prevents a high recommendation from me is that certain character beats were rushed. A longer runtime would’ve fleshed that out better.",,2023-07-21

Hollywood critics seem to really love Damien Chazelle. I personally loved <i>Whiplash </i>but didn’t care much about his other filmography. That being said, I was still curious about seeing this film just to complete his filmography. 

My overall thoughts are that there are some really good scenes throughout, but they don’t really fit in together. It’s like parts of eight different movies are together here, but we don’t fully flesh out any of them with a purpose. 

Parts I liked:
I will give Damien Chazelle credit for taking a hugely different direction from his other films and going all out. It doesn’t really feel similar to anything else in his filmography. 
The one consistency Damian Chazelle has through all his filmography is the amazing music. Love all the jazz from Justin Hurwitz. 
There are very interesting perspectives brought up about filmmaking. The change of silent films to talkies brings scary reality checks to artists that excel in silent film but not in talkies. While we already saw this explored with <i>Singin’ in the Rain</i>, I think it was explored fresh enough here to not feel too derivative (despite it making many references to <i>Singin’ in the Rain</i>). In particular, the scene with all the filmmakers trying to get a shot with pitch silence was absolutely hilarious. 
Despite it being over three hours long, I stayed interested and wasn’t bored. 
Acting across the board was great. I don’t know how Margot Robbie and Brad Pitt manage to act perfectly in all the range they have. 
Just like Spielberg’s <i>The Fabelmans </i>and Tarantino’s <i>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</i>, we have another film about the love of film yet being so unique from the rest. 

There were lots of aspects that were mentioned but not explored much. For example, Manuel moving up in the Hollywood ladder by trying to come off as from Spain instead of from Mexico. The rise and fall of actors that excel in silent films but not talkies. Sidney being instructed to use blackface. Each of these would’ve been fascinating films on their own, but this film is trying to be all of those films and more. But it just can’t manage all of them together and it just becomes messy. 

What really did not work for me was the raunchiness. I still don’t understand what this raunchiness was trying to communicate. I genuinely just felt like shock humor, similar to what raunchy comedies do. I welcome inappropriate things when it makes sense (like in <i>The Wolf of Wall Street</i>) but it just didn’t make sense here. 

There’s enough to appreciate here to make me give it a positive review, but overall I am frustrated that it could’ve been better.",,2023-07-22

This was a super fun theater experience. Everyone in the crowd just went to laugh together. I’m glad that a huge theatrical cult following grew around a movie that’s not a “must-see-on-the-big-screen”. This shows that everyday audiences still value the theatrical experience, which is a win for everyone. 

What’s unquestionably praiseworthy are the visuals of Barbieland - they got the exact look and feel of it down. 

I will also praise how risky this film is. It easily could’ve been an everyday animated movie tailored to kids and overall very safe. But, it took the risk of taking a kids IP into a PG-13 setting and trying to do a greater message. 
Some super funny movie trivia - the live action Scooby-Doo films from 20 years ago were supposed to be PG-13 raunchy comedies. But, test screenings with parents were hugely critical of this direction so the film got strongly edited to a PG rating. In todays world where comedy filmmaking can’t be too edgy to get canceled, it’s pretty impressive that this film could get away with its risky direction. 

As much as I loved the theatrical experience, I personally started feeling many flaws as I thought about it in retrospect. For example, people in the “real world” act like complete goofballs without explanation. Some jokes felt edgy in the moment, but in hindsight were really just statements and not jokes. The message isn’t consistent if you think about it too much. 

I don’t think my critical thoughts should be scoffed off just because I’m not the “target audience”. Films may be catered towards certain demographics, but if it’s a good film it would still be consistently appreciated by all demographics. 
Also, a flawless version of this type of movie already exists - <i>Enchanted</i>. It both pokes fun of and praises its source material of Disney princess worlds. It has edgy and laugh-out-loud humor that is also accessible to children. It has a message that is consistent. I would much prefer rewatching <i>Enchanted</i> over this film.",,2023-07-23

I agree with everyone else that Christopher Nolan is one of the greatest film directors working together. 
My favorite film of his is Memento - arguably one of me favorite films ever. It’s proof that you don’t need a large budget to have a strong thriller. No other film puts you in the direct viewpoint of the protagonist’s viewpoint as successfully as this one. You are solving the puzzle along with the protagonist. 
It is also remarkable that Nolan is still legendary when he gets large budgets. No other film can generate mindblowing visuals like what Inception and Tenet offers. 

As much as I love Nolan, I do agree that his later films have gotten unnecessarily confusing and his loud sound choices are distracting. Dunkirk was fun, but it got too complicated for its own good. I hope that eventually he goes back to his low budget and simpler times. 

Overall, as much as I was looking forward to this film, I was nervous about his negatives taking over. I think my ultimate thoughts basically matched my expectations - amazing at times, frustrating at other times. 

My biggest praise is the story itself. It’s pretty common knowledge that atomic bombs are scary, but until this film I don’t think everyday people thought about the developers’ perspectives of the atomic bomb. It’s a magnificent scientific achievement, but does that mean we should create it? In many ways we are experiencing the same question in regards to artificial intelligence today. 
It was smart to keep everything from Oppenheimer’s perspective. This is not just a historical retelling of events, but a character study. I expected my heart to sink from the visuals of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The film instead focused on Oppenheimer’s guilt of creating that, which somehow feels even worse. Unlike most films where visual spectacles have a dazzling feel, this one has a uniquely depressing feel. 

Good performances for sure, but Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer was amazing. Not once did I see Cillian Murphy - I only saw Oppenheimer. 

This film is completely focused on dialogue. I’m not against that, but the dialogue needs to be spectacular to grab my attention. I am admittedly picky on this, and really only love it when Aaron Sorkin is the screenwriter (e.g. The Social Network, Molly’s Game). I acknowledge this film has great dialogue, but going through all of it for three hours wasn’t for my personal taste. 

I know all the backstory with creating this film. Nolan made it with IMAX cameras, and IMAX 70mm is his ideal method of viewing. There are allegedly no CGI shots in the film. Attention to detail in filmmaking background is always impressive to me. But, I usually grade all that by the final product - did this attention to detail lead to a stronger viewing experience? I can say a resounding yes to this question for Tom Cruise’s films - he does his own action stunts, and that genuinely leads to better tension in the film. On the other hand, I did not feel an elevated impact with this film (even thought I saw it in IMAX 70mm, the intended format). I didn’t feel like anything was more grand as a result of the filmmaking background. I really wanted to be that film snob to show off my knowledge of all viewing formats and explain why IMAX and 70mm is the way, but I genuinely don’t feel the difference after watching this film. 
Even in this ideal film format, dialogue was still unclear to understand at times. So I’m not convinced on the theory that muddled dialogue in Nolan films doesn’t occur in better quality film formats. 
What I did feel grand about was watching it in the TCL Chinese Theater in Hollywood. The seating is almost 1000 people and it was basically sold out. The whole interior was grand like a broadway show. Someone at the front announced an introduction into the film. I feel honored to experience this film in that theater (even if I’m not strongly positive about it).",,2023-07-23
2023-08-02,Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,2023,https://boxd.it/4D3Gnv,4,,"I’ve played some DnD before: I’m not as invested into the lore of characters and spells like others, probably because I never really love medieval settings. But I love the “improv” open-ended aspect of the game. I expected this film to either lean deep into the lore or get fairly meta with a player’s rolls and choices influencing the direction of the characters. 

Interestingly this film went neither of those directions. It was just a pure fun humorous film set in a medieval world. Accessible to absolutely anyone. Not trying to be overly preachy, not trying to set up a franchise. Just pure fun. 

This film went a direction with many silly jokes. I expected to hate this and take me away from all tension (similar to how the current MCU is). But, all the jokes were genuinely funny and still made sense within the world. 
There is one particular silly cameo that was super hilarious to me. 

It surprisingly had a lot of heart too. Near the end there was a heartwarming that I didn’t expect and almost felt emotional about it. 

I also appreciated that the characters played by Chris Pine and Michelle Rodriguez didn’t go a typical romantic route. They just had an amicable co-parenting friendship. It made sense for this world and didn’t need unnecessary distracting romance. 

I do wish this film had better box office profits because I would like more fun movies like this. It had a big budget, but I guess it was necessary to make the medieval world with dragons and creatures not feel fake.

2023-08-02,Cocaine Bear,2023,https://boxd.it/4D3IzN,1,,"Not at all a fan of this. I wanted to enjoy it but I just couldn’t. 

Creature features tend to fall into two directions. There are thrillers like Alien and Jurassic Park, which are my personal favorite. There are “so bad it’s good” movies like Piranha 3D and Sharknado that purposely have terrible acting and plot choices and go for the easy stupid jokes. We all want to hate them, but they have sequels so clearly enough of us want to watch them. 

I was confused what section this film is trying to fall into. There were weirdly written characters and inconsistently edited scenes. I couldn’t tell if they were purposely bad. For example, there is a moment when kids try cocaine as a joke. If the movie went a thriller route, the kids would later not be in a smart state with a bear and therefore add additional tension. If the movie went a “so bad it’s good” route, the kids would have an acid trip scene with a bear for some stupid silly humor. However, the kids never act under the influence in subsequent scenes. So the only reason the kids do cocaine is for a quick and easy joke, and then nothing is subsequently done with this. 

Lots of characters are introduced through various directions in the park with the bear, but it never made sense who to root for. Characters that didn’t really do anything wrong suffer huge injuries and then become relatively forgotten. Park rangers and medical professionals make clearly wrong decisions. So it was hard to care about any of them surviving the blight.",,2023-07-25
2023-08-02,Passengers,2016,https://boxd.it/4D3Ld1,4.5,,"This film has been hugely underrated in my opinion. Interestingly, this may be the only film where I actually disagree with most of the critics I follow. I went in with very low expectations given that most critics I align with were negative, and I ended up loving this movie.  I think it offers a lot that is unique in the industry, and poses many valuable subsequent discussion topics. I’m glad this film at least made enough money to break even, but I hope it is rediscovered in the future. 

First off, the production design is absolutely beautiful. We’ve seen many sci-fi films with huge budgets towards the visual effects, and the ones that take a polished direction just feel fake and tired. The design of this spaceship is so different than anything else we’ve seen, and it actually makes sense for the purpose of commercial space travel. I also loved the scene where gravity is lost in the pool room - that is probably the craziest setting to have a gravity loss scenario. I’m sure a lot of CGI was used, but the look fit the feel of the film so I was fine with it. 

Now onto the controversial plot piece. The marketing led us to believe that Chris Pratt’s Jim and Jennifer Lawrence’s Aurora were both accidentally removed from their respective sleeper pods. What actually happens is that only Jim is accidentally awakened, but he later wakes up Aurora because he feels lonely. 
I think most were angry with this choice because it went against the marketing. Personally, I think it was smart to have this marketing and direction together because it subverts expectations. 
I’m sure a good subset of people would view this choice as an example of “toxic masculinity”. But, I think the film made a strong justification for Jim ultimately making this choice. He had a whole year of loneliness and depression (as any of us would in that situation). Enough runtime is spent with him questioning if he should make this choice, and through his thought process he continually knows how wrong it is. Also, it’s not like he chose to wake Aurora JUST by her good looks - he reads up on her background and finds happiness in it. I think this makes him know that they would get along together, rather than waking up an everyday good looking person. 
I heard some suggest that this film would’ve been a lot better if this choice was instead displayed as a third act reveal and have a “creepy horror” tone with Aurora continuously questioning if Jim woke her up. I think this definitely would’ve also made an interesting film. But, I prefer what we actually got. What we got is, again, a much more unique direction that we rarely see in films. We got through this film with knowledge of the secret, feeling the same guilt that Jim is feeling. 
Finally, another criticism I’ve heard is that the film lets Jim get away with the terrible choice. I don’t agree with this take. Once Aurora finds out, she is rightfully angry and they spend most of the runtime afterwards expectedly apart - this time is basically Jim paying the consequences for his actions. And in the end, there is an option for Aurora to go back to cryosleep and live the ultimate life she wanted. 
All in all, I believe this twist in the first act is the best version of this film. “Would you do what Jim did?” is a great topic of debate, and I’m glad the film poses the question. 

I do really enjoy that this is a romance film set in a sci-fi world. Usually I hate forced romances in sci-fi. But here, I viewed it as a romance film first and sci-fi film second. I also believed the romance between them could exist because Jim chose to wake up Aurora based on her personality so he knew they would get along. 

This film easily could’ve gone a “woke” direction by focusing on how the capitalistic spaceship company could be abusing the profits from these travels. This is proof that a film can pose deep questions that aren’t just the same tired political talking points. 

A slight tangent: I think I normally would’ve criticized this film for depending on the convenience that this huge spaceship (and related company) could have no handling for an early wake up scenario. But, we did just experience TitanGate which is very similar. 

One of the criticisms I heard is that aspects of this film was borrowed from other films like <i>The Shining</i> and <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i>. I admittedly haven’t watched either of those two films so I can’t comment on that piece. But from what I heard about those two films, I still believe that this film is unique enough to not warrant such a criticism. 

The only part that didn’t work for me is the subplot with the spaceship malfunctioning and Jim/Aurora working with Laurence Fishburne’s Gus to resolve the issues. It was like the studio forced the filmmakers to add sci-fi/thriller elements into the middle. I generally like that this allows Jim and Aurora to be heroes to everyone else on the ship. But believing that Jim as a mechanic could actually do astronautical engineering work to save everyone is a huge convenience. 

A nitpick: Another fun discussion to have with people is how to end the movie. I think the basic plot for the ending definitely works. I like that it ends with Aurora’s final written story being how she and Jim lived a beautiful life together and that they are the reason everyone else could make it to their destination. A random YouTube video showed me other potential options. For example, Jim and Aurora have a child that they raise for a couple years and then the child gets the extra cryosleep pod. Or Aurora kills Jim during the anger phase, and then later Aurora is given the same moral conundrum of if she should wake up someone else to cure her subsequent loneliness and depression. 

Andy Garcia’s existence in the film is super funny to me. Very few directors can get away with being allowed to have an A-list star for a couple second non-speaking cameo. How Morten Tyldum was allowed to do this will forever be humorous to me. 

Overall, this film is so unique amongst any other films with A-list actors. I don’t get why many disliked it. I hope it can get a revived appreciation in the future.",,2023-07-27
2023-08-02,Philadelphia,1993,https://boxd.it/4D3N2J,3,,"A film with Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington? Immediately ready to watch it. 

I’m a huge fan of Tom Hanks, so I was looking forward to finally watch the film that got him an Oscar. After viewing this, I can definitely agree that he deserved the Oscar for this. 
I would’ve given Denzel one for this film too. I like that his character starts out as wanting to stay away from Tom Hanks, but then ultimately becomes understanding. 

I like that this film chooses to not immediately share if the law firm is guilty. The case is initially presented to make you believe that discrimination probably did not happen. So as the viewer, you believe that this is a difficult case to win. 

I think it is also believable that the truth only comes out about the discrimination after Tom Hanks’s character’s health is in a deteriorating state. Unfortunately, It’s natural to stop discriminating someone after  they go through a tragedy. 

I don’t think this is a must-see amongst every other film that exists. But it is a good time-pass.",,2023-07-30
2023-08-02,Disenchanted,2022,https://boxd.it/4D3ObR,3,,"I experienced the first film relatively recently, and I absolutely loved it. It was such a fun journey that both poked fun at and respected the Disney princess films, with great songs and characters. I know the first film holds closely to others. It probably would’ve to me too if I saw it around the time it released. 

My biggest praise for this film is that it is very unique. It didn’t try to shamelessly recreate the first film, but it tried to just do something new with the same characters. It went a somewhat natural direction as what ten years after a “happily ever after” romantic ending would be. 

My next praise is the performance of Amy Adams. She was perfectly cast as a naive princess in the first film. This film added a layer where she had to alternate between being the naive princess and being a wicked villain. It was a lot of fun seeing her suddenly shift across both personalities. 

While I do praise the film for having a unique direction, it is also a flaw. It seemed to have many various plots that don’t seem to relate to each other and don’t get fully fleshed out. For example, the film opens with a teenage daughter hating a move and dealing with her stepmother. I was looking forward to how this would go because I relate to the teenage angst. But, about halfway through the film it ends up exploring other plot points and seemed to forget about answering this one. 

Part of me felt like the filmmakers didn't watch the first film while making this one. For example, there is a scene in this film where Giselle's daughter needs clothes for school. This is such an easy joke/callback for Giselle to create a dress from curtains. But, that doesn't happen.

These types of films are obviously not meant to be over analyzed. It is a reliable and harmless fun time with enjoyable characters. Just don’t expect the same “lightning in a bottle” experience as the first film.",,2023-07-30
2023-08-03,Triangle of Sadness,2022,https://boxd.it/4Dn0FR,0.5,,"This has got to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I don't understand how it was nominated for so many Oscars, including Best Picture.

This is apparently a comedy, but I never laughed. Dialogue of blunt opinions on why rich people suck (and other anti-capitalism sentiment) is not real comedy. I'm not against a film making statements like this, but they have to at least feel like they have an artistic purpose. Over-the-top puke scenes on a yacht, buzzing flies everywhere, and multiple camera shutter sounds are just gross and annoying.
If the people praising the film just super connecting to the anti-capitalism message, there is a much better movie called <i>The Menu </i>and it should’ve been nominated for all those Oscars instead of this film. 

This film also includes a donkey death scene, which I will interpret as a bad rip-off of <i>The Banshees of Inisherin</i>. It also includes a hamburger eating scene, which I will interpret as a bad rip-off of <i>The Menu</i>.",,2023-07-31
2023-08-03,Ford v Ferrari,2019,https://boxd.it/4DpuMx,5,,"I feel so pumped up just thinking about this!!

For some reason, I didn’t really feel compelled to watch this in theaters when it came out because I thought it was going to be random Oscar bait. Goodness was I wrong. 

Immediately in the first couple minutes, my adrenaline rushed. I did not expect race car driving to actually be thrilling, considering that drivers just stay in the same position in a car the whole time. I also did not expect corporate bureaucratic to only be gripping but also compliment the race car driving scenes well. 
I think the reason the race car thrills work well is because we get the right context to feel that way. We see that these are new cars just getting tested now, always prone to failure. We see nearby cars suffer huge crashes and fear our protagonists get the same fate. 
The adrenaline rush continues consistently through the whole runtime. 

In a way, this follows the stereotypical beats of a sports drama. Even then, I felt all the right emotional beats at the right moments. Bonus points, knowing that this is all a true story. 

Huge respect for James Mangold. He’s made solid films in all types of genres. 

I saw this movie on an airplane. I soon realized the plane was going to land much earlier than the film would end. So for the last thirty minutes, I watched it on 1.5x speed. That made the final scenes so much more thrilling (but I definitely don’t recommend doing that unless necessary lol)",,2023-07-31
2023-08-09,The Northman,2022,https://boxd.it/4FkBzj,5,,"Imagine The Lion King, but a live-action adaptation that is rated R with Viking mythology.

I am huge proponent of the idea that no one should avoid a film just on the basis of the genre. There are great films in all genres, and there is bound to always be something from every genre that connects well with anyone. 
That being said, I'm typically not a fan of the viking/medieval settings or Norse mythology. I generally find it difficult to relate to the characters, it can get overly gruesome, and the lore/prophecies can become distracting. Pretty much the only exception to this for me is Game of Thrones. And now, I will add this film as an exception!

What worked best for me is that despite it's large world and budget and mystical portions, it is ultimately a simple revenge plot. And the focus simply stayed on Amleth working to seek revenge. No other complicated subplots. Any other additions involved Amleth somehow and contributed to his decision-making. We see firsthand what motivates each of his choices. Further plot complications would have personally detracted me from showing interest. 

The next best thing is that the world felt fully realized. Nothing seemed like CGI. All the characters were truly from the historical time period. Everyone had real blood and sweat and dirt on their bodies, so the actors truly put themselves into the mess of the world. There were impressive oner shots that focused on making the world real (rather than showing off that they can do a oner).
Like I said earlier, I normally don’t like the Viking setting. But here I think I could buy into it because it makes sense for characters to have a barbaric nature in this world. If a modern day setting film involved a bloodthirsty sport or killing slaves with no thought, it would be unwatchable. Here, you’re not surprised that such behaviors are a part of the world. It also smartly adds to the danger of Amleth’s revenge plot. 

Without spoiling anything, there is a certain twist from the character of Gudrun that I really didn't expect and added some great depth to the plot.

2023-08-10,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,2023,https://boxd.it/4FOo3f,4,,"A fun MCU ride!

While not perfect, this felt relieving like pre-Endgame MCU. Focused on making a good movie, and not on setting up future projects. This is likely because James Gunn was allowed more creative control than other MCU directors. 

My quick summary of the prior installments:
<i>Guardians of the Galaxy </i>is arguably one of my favorite films. It came out of the blue, and felt the best like a ragtag group of friends living life together. Also very praiseworthy that they could introduce so many characters without feeling exposition heavy. 
<i>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 </i>was very fine. I really like these characters, which elevated this film above average though. 
<i>Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special </i>was a lot of fun, and I’m glad they churned it out while shooting this film. And I’m a sucker for anything Christmas. 

My favorite part of this film is everything around Rocket’s backstory. People talked about how <i>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness </i>was great for incorporating horror elements into the MCU - I don’t agree with that. But, this film definitely brought in the best horror elements. The concept of mechanical tinkering on living entities is incredibly creepy to me. This film explored that very well. It frankly made me feel very emotional about Rocket. I don’t remember the prior films well enough to comment on if this backstory is consistent enough, but I also don’t care because it was such a good story. If this backstory was its own film, it could easily be an Oscar contender. But of course, we know that will never happen because all MCU properties have to follow the same formulas. 

Next, any adventure with these characters is fun. This franchise does a good job of introducing really weird worlds with their own quirks to generate quick laughs, but at the same time don’t let you think too much about how this all works. 

Without spoiling anything, the direction of each main character made a lot of sense (even if the plot didn’t get there perfectly). 

The tonal shifts between the serious and not-so-serious elements are admittedly odd. It didn’t frustrate me by any means, but still felt weird. 

Another MCU offense here is with introducing unnecessary iconic villains. Years ago, <i>Spider-Man 3 </i>was shamed for introducing so many villains into one film. I don’t know why superhero movies still do this. Taskmaster was wasted in <i>Black Widow</i>, M.O.D.O.K. was wasted in <i>Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania</i>. Now Warlock was wasted in this film.",,2023-08-06
2023-08-10,Shazam! Fury of the Gods,2023,https://boxd.it/4FOvi7,3,,"A fine time-pass superhero movie, elevated with some fun silly humor. 

I really like the concept of Shazam - a kid in the body of a yoked superhero. That keeps anything Shazam fresh for me. The first half of the film stayed investing for me for this reason. I totally bought the idea of adults acting silly because of their young minds (even if the young version really aren’t <i>that</i> young). 

The special effects with the buildings moving were actually really cool too. 

Rachel Ziegler’s character went a direction I did not expect in the first half, but in a good twist way.

I like the setup of how the whole film starts, and how it influences the direction of Tom Hanks’ character. 

The main issue for me was that I didn’t really care about going on the journey. I don’t really believe that a story like this could ever occur in real life.

2023-08-11,3:10 to Yuma,2007,https://boxd.it/4G63yn,4.5,,"A fun thrill with surprisingly investing characters!

The only westerns I’ve experienced before this were basically released before the 1980s so I always associated the genre with kinda slow for today’s standards. This film makes me want to revisit those westerns. I think this is a entry into the genre for anyone because it has modern actors and visual effects, but still keeps the historical western feel. 

I really like that while this is a western, it’s really just a simple and relatable story that happens to exist in a western setting. It utilizes the western genre well. For example, a modern thriller would not be able to get away with everyday people willing to kill a random person for money. On the other hand, a western is one of the only genres where everyday people can do this and the film doesn’t lose credibility. 

The simple story is about the moral Dan Evans transporting the outlaw Ben Wade to jail. We’ve seen setups like this many times before. But, both characters end up having a surprising amount of depth so the journey is enjoyable. There is also an addition with Dan’s son that added nice flavor. 

The only reason this doesn’t get a perfect score is that I felt the thrill wasn’t at full capacity. It could’ve been a bit faster paced to feel more grip and yearn to see it through to the end.",,2023-08-10
2023-08-15,Strange World,2022,https://boxd.it/4HhNE3,2,,"Overall a harmless kids movie, but your time is better spent revisiting any of the Disney classics. 

Many seem to criticize this movie for attempting concepts that were better portrayed in other movies. I’m personally totally fine with movies showing typical concepts as long as they have a fun journey. Superhero movies and rom-coms go through many cliches, but new ones in those genres still turn audiences when they have a fun journey. In fact, even Disney animations have many similarities with each other, but each journey has its own charm to stand out. Unfortunately, the journey in this movie just wasn’t interesting enough to praise. 

For Disney animations, I tend to critique by charm and message. This film failed on both ends. 

First on charm. I guess this kinda goes hand in hand with merchandising ability. I don’t fully remember the plots of <i>Moana </i>or <i>Encanto</i>, for example, but they each offered worlds that were fascinating to explore through all ages. On the other hand, this film had nothing charming about its world. It may have been visually stunning on the big screen, but it didn’t translate to the television screen. 
Also, the movie purposely didn’t answer many rules about the world from the start in order to build up a mystery that is revealed in the third act. While this isn’t the worst idea, it prevents us from delving into why creatures act the way they do (and then get fascinated with it). 
Also, many jokes just fall flat. I was watching the whole movie with a straight face, and not a smile. 

Next, on message. Again, I think the main goal of Disney animations is to provide a fun journey. But, the best ones share a simple heartwarming message to tie it all in a nice bow and provides emotional weight for even adults. <i>Frozen </i>had a beautiful message on the value of sisterhood. <i>Inside Out </i>(probably the most complex that concepts should go for Disney animations) taught us that all emotions (and not just joy) are what make us human and special. On the other hand, this film tries to bring in many messages and doesn’t flesh out any of them well. 
The film opens with Jaegar being a beloved celebrity, but Searcher viewing him with disdain as a terrible father. Then we see Ethan, Searcher’s son, who wants to learn more about his grandfather but his father pushes him away from this. I was really looking forward to explore this situation, because it is pretty unique and very relatable. We all have relatives that we disagree with - do we ignore the bad and keep a familial relationship, or do we treat it like any other people and avoid contact? What is the effect this has on our children? Is there a middle ground?
Unfortunately, we just don’t explore that concept well. We then also hear about Ethan’s teenage love struggles, and this tries to be a prominent subplot but it really doesn’t make sense to include given the plot. There’s an environmental message in the middle. There is then also a coup that occurs in an extremely shoehorned manner. By trying to do so much, none of them get enough depth to flesh out. 

All in all, I think this film is getting harsh treatment by saying that this is terrible for our children. I would not go that far - children will probably just view this as an average watch. But, there isn’t much to praise here to counteract the harsh treatment.",,2023-08-13
2023-08-18,The Mule,2018,https://boxd.it/4I9N0b,3,,"A good time-pass. 

This doesn’t really do anything cutting-edge in filmmaking. But hey, not every film needs to do that! As long as it entertains the audience, you met the goal. 

So far, my observation of Clint Eastwood’s directing style is that he goes for realism. It’s as if I am a fly on the wall around real events occurring. And the realism means that dialogue will come off fairly average and not gripping. I think it’s a good signature style. It worked out very well for <i>Sully </i>as it fit the actual events and character of the protagonist. Here, it felt like it was just fine. Not bad, just fine. 
It’s also so remarkable that even at such an age, Clint Eastwood can direct and star in films at the same time and produce a cohesive result. Truly inspiring. That makes me continuously curious to watch his filmography, but I know most people don’t really notice who crewmembers are when they watch a film. 

This film is based on a true story that is pretty fascinating. Even if the film dramatizes events, the concept is interesting enough to stay through the runtime. 

I felt strongly mixed on some choices around certain words and actions of the protagonist. 
On one side, the protagonist isn’t meant to be perfectly moral. Films like this are most interesting to me because they make choices that an everyday audience member would not do, but we still stay invested because we can believe that this character would do such choices. 
On the other hand, I don’t really know what those choices add to the overall. It sorta felt like the choices were made to shock the audience, rather than add to the character development. 

Overall worth watching once to complete your Eastwood filmography. In general, a good enough time pass.",,2023-08-16
2023-08-20,Bo Burnham: Inside,2021,https://boxd.it/4J27jb,4.5,,"This is so crazy that it might actually be incredibly genius. 

I tried stand-up comedy a couple years ago. It was fun for a moment and I’m glad I tried it, but it ultimately isn’t for me. The main thing I didn’t like about it is that it’s just me at the front with the task of making everyone laugh often, and it feels awkward when I don’t get the laughs. 
So, I now have lots of respect for successful stand up comedians. A step above that is major respect for whatever Bo Burnham did here. 

This is not just and everyday comedy special that you watch once and then forget about. This was a full on one-man performance. At least with the stand-up specials, you hear the audience laughter. But here, it is literally just Bo the whole time. Truly commendable that one person compiled all this. This is proof that restrictions are not an excuse to not create quality cinematic content.
It’s also funny because anyone can clearly tell that this is very low budget and technically anyone can have the ability to create something like this. But, no one can create this as quality content like Bo. 

I personally wasn’t looking forward to watching this when originally released during the pandemic. I wanted films as an escape from the reminder that I’m in a pandemic, so I avoided content that literally was about the pandemic. So that’s why I waited until now to see it. 

Like <i>The Menu</i>, I don’t know what genre this is. This is not a “comedy special” like other stand up specials. This is a comedy in that I laughed often, but there was also a slight depressive flair to it. It gave me emotions that no other piece of film could do. 
This was a hugely risky. Too much depressive mess would’ve felt like too much pity. Too much comedy would’ve felt out of place. Bo may have gone incredibly crazy while creating this, but somehow managed to get a perfect combination of all emotions into it. 

My one nitpick is that there were a couple sections that felt like it went longer than it should’ve. I would at the joke, then feel some frustration that the joke was still going and wish I could just get to the next set. I’m sure some of this is “intentional” to lean into a part of the crazy. But, I bought into all the other craziness so I’m comfortable with staying this as a minor flaw. 

I think this is a great piece of work to show kids 20 years from now to show what the pandemic was actually like. Sure, the history books will show stuff like the number of Covid deaths and other historical information, but what was it like for the everyday person that is quarantining? This perfectly encapsulates it. Working on some random project by yourself with the tools available in your home. Finding fun in the minimalism. Then at times going really crazy. Can’t wait to revisit this 20 years from now.",,2023-08-19

Definitely very cool to watch a film and then its director/producer/star discuss their enjoyment with creating the film. If cinequest is looking at Letterboxd reviews for satisfaction ratings - I’d say that I wish we got a lot more interview time with the crew. Hearing the backstory on how the film was made is always fascinating because it most definitely takes more effort than what everyday people think. 

Without the Cinequest experience (and the joyous feeling of supporting an independent film), I don’t think I can recommend this. There are many other movies of this type that are more investing. 

It’s worth commending the cinematography and screenplay. Not amazing, but was commendable for an independent film. 

I found that a lot of the audio was difficult to understand. Not sure if that was due to subpar sound mixing or audio issues with the theater.

2023-08-26,The Flash,2023,https://boxd.it/4KKKUn,4,,"A solid superhero film providing the appropriate amount of joy and thrill. 

My personal favorites in the DCEU are those where Zach Snyder had the most involvement. I’m still frustrated with the studio interference preventing Snyder from fully realizing his vision. At a time when the MCU leaned into quips back and forth, the DCEU could have been great counter-programming in a more serious and realistic tone. I’m glad this film connected more to the Snyder-verse, even if the main character’s nature is quippy. 

Almost every review seems to call out the terrible CGI. Seeing this film on a television rather than the big screen, I couldn’t really tell if anything was outright terrible. I’m willing to pass off the filmmakers’ remarks that the unrealistic CGI was a choice for the Speed Force scenes. Most importantly, I don’t think CGI should make or break the sentiment with a film - this is dependent on many more things like plot and character developments. 

Besides other films in the DCEU, this is my first interaction with the superhero of The Flash. This film makes me want to explore the character more (even though we obviously won’t for many reasons). This film is another reason why I really don’t look forward to a rebooted DC universe. 

Even though I’m so tired of quips from the MCU, I could actually accept the jokey nature of this film as a part of the Snyderverse. This is because Barry Allen is an immature young adult by nature. Silly actions also made sense for his superpowers (e.g. needing to eat frantically to get energy for superhero duties). And while we may not make the same stupid decisions as our main character, we understand why he does them. 
It was also fun to explore the interactions of young adult Barry with high school Barry. I’d go as far as saying this is some of the best acting and is awards worthy (although Ezra Miller obviously won’t win awards due to many controversies). 
Overall, all the ludicrous set pieces the film goes through are acceptable within this film because they are all interesting situations to make Barry Allen navigate. 

Despite the jokes, there is a deep emotional story about a son trying to get his parents back to normalcy. This is handled superbly and rightfully gets a lot of emotional weight. 

It is unfortunate that this film came out at this time, given that the multiverse has been explored in many other franchises. What I will say is I like this multiverse way more than what the MCU is doing. It explained the rules of the multiverse clearly and stuck to those rules, allowing audiences to not scoff it off. 

I’m also relieved that we finally have a superhero film that doesn’t have a love interest subplot. Love interests further character development well in some superhero films, but for the most part I feel its inclusion as an obligation. Here, it definitely wouldn’t have made sense to include it so I’m glad it didn’t. 

My main criticisms are around the editing. Scenes didn’t really stitch perfectly together. For example, you could tell there’s a version where Iris West’s has much more presence because what we got seemed oddly thrown together. This is not a fault on the filmmakers, but on Warner Bros. mismanagement of the DC IP. And given how much studio mismanagement occurred, it’s commendable that they were still able to make something competent enough. 

Sidebar: Barry’s stupid laugh sounds like that one random fish character in SpongeBob. Once I made that connection, I can’t unhear it. 

The hatred, mismanagement from Warner Bros., and low box-office returns are truly undeserving for the filmmakers that created this film. The filmmakers deserved much better.",,2023-08-25
2023-08-27,Batman,1989,https://boxd.it/4KWIZz,3,,"Glad to finally watch the Batman film involving Michael Keaton, Jack Nicholson, and Tim Burton! Checking off many filmography checklists here. 

I could imagine myself loving this film at the time of its release. No superhero film like it at its time. In todays world, I think there have since been better Batman interpretations and other superhero films that hold up better. 

I think the best part of this film is it’s interpretation of Gotham. Very well deserving of the Best Production Design Oscar. It felt very Blade Runner-esque, but still the dark Gotham look riddled with crime. Kudos to Tim Burton for forming this visionary world. 

Jack Nicholson is the next best part in my opinion. I didn’t realize this film is in some ways more a Joker film than a Batman film. I’m not upset about that since he was so good. Amongst all the film versions of Joker, this one is the creepiest on looks alone. Jack Nicholson kept the creepy smile through the whole performance somehow, which made everything even scarier. 

I don’t think this is a must-see version of Batman though. Michael Keaton was definitely good as Bruce Wayne and Batman, but he doesn’t hold up as well as what we’ve seen since. This film seems to incorporate both grit and campyness, and the tones don’t mesh perfectly together.

The best part of this film is that there is nothing else like it. It’s a romance film, but not a rom-com. So it has feel-good elements that a typical romance may have, but it gives you a unique feeling that the typical rom-coms don’t provide. I felt like I was watching history in the making, rather than just an everyday love story. 

The cinematography of 1970s Harlem setting is beautiful. I don’t really recall Harlem as a prominent setting in other films I watched. I could feel all the right vibes with it, as if I was actually in Harlem. This is all thanks to the music and color choices that meticulously crafted together. In many ways, the setting felt like it’s own character enhancing the developments of the people we witness. 

What I am more mixed on is some directorial choices. Many scenes lingered on longer than I would’ve liked, and I didn’t feel like there was an artistic reasoning behind those choices. Also, the film’s structure is non-linear which felt unnecessary. In addition, the family members of our protagonists seemed very fascinating but they didn’t get as much screen time or exploration as I would’ve liked. 
Other than those choices, I think Barry Jenkins is a great visionary and I look forward to experiencing the rest of his filmography!",,2023-08-30
2023-09-04,Lights Out,2016,https://boxd.it/4Nxf4r,2,,"Great idea, disappointing execution. 

I was intrigued by the teaser for this film for a while - the shots of a scary being moving closer with each subsequent light switch were perfect. Unfortunately, the actual film doesn’t play with that enough. 

I wanted this to be like <i>A Quiet Place</i>. Those films work very well because they know what to focus on and what not to focus on. Those films know the fear is with any sound so they make sure even the slightest sound gives you goosebumps. They focus on that simple concept and don’t get distracted with other things like trying to explain why these creatures operate the way they do. 
This film unfortunately doesn’t do that. It seemed like it would with a solid creepy opening. But, it focused too much on dysfunctional family dynamics and drama, as well as horror cliches. I kept wishing they would shift back to running away from the creature in creative ways. 

Also, I was taken away by poor acting and editing choices. There were cases of it breaking its own rules (e.g. creatures making sounds when they aren’t supposed to be). 
There was a subplot with a message about mental health - I’m not against it, but it didn’t seem to integrate well. 

What I will give credit to is that, unlike most horror movies, there aren’t blatant bad decisions made by characters. They make choices that fit their characters. 

One scene in particular involving a car’s headlights seemed like a great theater applause moment.",,2023-09-03
2023-09-11,2001: A Space Odyssey,1968,https://boxd.it/4PqkgV,5,,"The most artistic film to exist, in the best possible way. 

This film has been consistently ranked amongst the best films. I personally take that type of praise with caution, especially for older films. Expectations can go so high that they get broken, and a lot of the charm with films is it’s impact at the time of release. It’s rare that a film actually stays significant through the passage of time. For example, <i>Star Wars </i>for new audiences that don’t know any history will likely not be enjoyable. It only gets enjoyable when you understand more things (e.g. this was the first space adventure epic to exist in cinema, each set piece was manually handcrafted rather than CGI, stunning visuals and charm at the time of release) 
In contrast, I think this film will only get <i>better</i> over the passage of time. 

Every frame of this film was meticulously crafted. I’m sure a director commentary of this film would include pauses at every single frame, but I would be so invested to hear about why every choice was made. This is truly cinematic hypnotism. 

Even on today’s standards, this film is incredibly immersive. I really felt like I was in space, with the detailed visuals and set pieces. Many instances of just music, or no music but just visuals. The amount of human dialogue was actually a very low percentage. This would be a hugely risky choice because audiences could easily lose interest (which is probably why most movies may throw many exposition scenes to move the plot forward). While this film has less plot, it’s made up by the fact that we feel immersed. I never for a second felt like the visuals were limited by the filmmaking technology available at the time. 

This film is also one of the most terrifying movies I’ve ever watched. Most of today’s space films are epic adventures (e.g. <i>Star Wars</i>, <i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i>). But, this film has a reason for the plot to exist specifically in space. Space is it’s own character here. Space is a vast field of nothingness. Rogue technology is even more destructive in space. 

This film is a must-see for all. No other film like it exists.",,2023-09-04
2023-09-11,The Benchwarmers,2006,https://boxd.it/4PqkIv,4,,"An enjoyable time-pass silly comedy with a relatable anti-bullying theme. 

Yes, this is Adam Sandler style humor. Don’t expect the smartest and wittiest jokes. But, the type of jokes fit the theme given that the whole premise is with kids playing baseball and adults being immaturely invested into it. While they may go over the top with it (e.g. an adult that wears a helmet 24/7 and basically has no brain), it doesn’t detract from the experience. 

What elevated this movie for my was the anti-bullying sentiment. There was one annoying person in particular through my elementary, middle, and high school that frustrated everyone. Even just thinking about this guy can make my blood boil from the terrible memories. So, any movie that involves bullies getting a taste of their own medicine will strike a chord with me. 

It’s also always funny to see movies from over ten years ago have a take on what the future can hold with AI assistants. At the time, it’s almost joked off as something that can never happen. But now, a lot of that actually feels possible (if not now, at least soon).",,2023-09-09
2023-09-14,Saving Private Ryan,1998,https://boxd.it/4QsREJ,5,,"In every regard, this film surprised me with how much I cared about the journey. Just another reason why Steven Spielberg is one of our greats. 

I admittedly have not dabbled too much in the serious sides of Steven Spielberg. This film was probably the first major “serious” film of his that I watched. So, I was excited to see if I’d still appreciate this side of him. I expected to think I’d share obligatory praise rather than genuine praise. But, I came out of this with genuine praise and appreciation. I think any audience member will truly appreciate this film, and it still holds up so well. 

The very opening scene admittedly almost made me sigh at the cliche that the entire film is a flashback. Flashbacks don’t always work for me, because it means that the character we see survived all the mess that we will soon witness. Without spoiling anything, this opening actually worked very well for me by the time the film ended. 

The opening battle scene is absolutely horrific. We know Spielberg has made realistic adrenaline rushes from <i>Jaws </i>and <i>Jurassic Park</i>, amongst others. Despite being the same director, this opening battle scene was very different. This was the first time I truly experienced what it’s like to be in a battlefield. People in subpar situations have to fight for their lives with a huge disadvantage. Peers are obliterated without a proper goodbye. The need to have strong mental willpower to move forward, even when you know the odds are stacked against you. It’s no surprise that veterans had difficulty watching this scene because, well, anyone would! 

Once this opening battle scene ended, I was surprised with the pivot that the plot took. The rest of the film was about finding Private Ryan and bringing him home, and not about more US military battles. I was ready to criticize the fact that the opening battle scene, while great, feels like it’s a different film compared to the rest. But, it slowly ended up retroactively enhancing the rest. The film does a great job of constantly questioning the point of this side mission in the grand scheme of the World War. All the men on this journey feel that way, and so do we as the audience. A death along the side mission is just not honorable in the way that death on a battlefield is. Without spoiling anything, this plot direction actually works well for the overall story. 
I also admire Spielberg’s behind the scenes choice here. He apparently cast Matt Damon because he was relatively unknown at the time and purposely left him out of boot camp with the other military actors because it would cause them to psychologically hate Private Ryan. What a great idea!

One of my biggest praises of Spielberg is how realistic the dialogue in his film sounds. I can say the same thing here. Everyone talked in ways that I expect military officials to talk. Non-PC, with moments where they open up to each other. 

In many ways, I can see how the modern superhero formula borrows from this film. But this film feels way more real than any superhero film. Here, the battles are with genuinely normal powered people, meaning that anyone can die at any point. Adds tension in a way that superhero films cannot. 

Despite my praise for the film, I will caution that I don’t actually think this film is a “war” film. Yes, it takes place in a war setting, but it is not at all about the US trying to win a war. It is more an adventure that takes place in a war setting. Not a criticism, just for expectation setting.",,2023-09-13
2023-09-18,Air,2023,https://boxd.it/4RoMOP,4.5,,"A thrilling ride about the historical founding of Air Jordans. 

Despite knowing the current success of Nike and Air Jordans (and Michael Jordan), it’s still engrossing to watch these Nike workers hustle for their success. This is because everyone at Nike has a scrappy hard-working culture yearning for a big break. Despite being a huge corporation, we still see the character of these individuals and want them to succeed. We also believe that every step they take is a huge financial risk and want it to pay off. 

One of the most interesting facets of film for me is that I will appreciate a film even about things I hate, as long as it’s filmed well. I’m not at all into watching Formula One racing, but I loved <i>Ford v Ferrari</i>. I’m not at all into Viking culture, but I loved <i>The Northman</i>. 
Similarly, I’m personally not at all into sports culture or watching sports on tv. I barely know anything about Michael Jordan. But, I was super into this film. I believed the risk of designing a shoe with more than 50% color for basketball. I believed the risk of directly contacting an athlete’s parents instead of through the agent. This film walked through that whole process without feeling like exposition so that any background could be gripped. 

I love how detail-oriented this production design was. This was a time where using a phone in a car was revolutionary. Media was consumed through VCRs. Details like this truly enhance how invested you are into the time period. 

Performances across the board were amazing. Matt Damon can somehow still act as an everyday man wanting a big break, and we want him to win even though he’s a giant celebrity. I’m sure anyone could see their admirable mother in Viola Davis. I wish I can see Chris Tucker more often than like every five years. 

Three nitpicks prevented me from absolutely loving this movie:
First, there’s many sequences of pop culture/real scenes from the 1980s. I felt these to be out of place. I was already immersed in the time period with the production design and costuming. So these felt unnecessary. 
Second, there’s a choice to never show the face of Michael Jordan’s actor in the film. I understand the idea of focusing on his parents and Nike workers rather than Michael Jordan. But, the blatant camera movements to cover his face behind other people felt awkward. 
Third, there are a couple lines that are super raunchy. I’m not against this if it’s limited, but when it’s overboard it has to have a purpose. For example, The Wolf of Wall Street is one of the most raunchy films I’ve seen but I feel it was appropriate to elevate the wild lifestyle of hedge fund workers. I didn’t see the purpose of including raunchiness in this film (other than quick laughs).",,2023-09-15
2023-09-26,The Super Mario Bros. Movie,2023,https://boxd.it/4TMDbP,3.5,,"A serviceable kids movie, elevated if you are a Mario fan. 

I actually really liked the set up of this movie, where Mario and Luigi are in the “human” world and then get transported to the Mushroom Kingdom. That brought in some fun background with their brotherhood and how they react to things in the Mushroom Kingdom. 
Other than that opening, the entire film was really just a safe plot with many references to Mario games. Not bad by any means, but don’t expect anything more in the plot. 

What the film really nailed was the look and feel of the world. It genuinely had all the charm that the video games share. Hats off to Illumination for somehow making great looking animated films with low budgets. Disney/Pixar makes films with double budget (seemingly to making very realistic looking portions), but I don’t get why they do it because Illumination is able to get the same charm with much less budget. 

I expected to hate the voice casting, but it actually didn’t detract from the feel. I felt immediately off when watching the trailers, but didn’t feel that way from watching the film. 
In particular, Jack Black as Bowser and Charlie Day as Luigi are standouts. Would love to see more of them. 
Chris Pratt as Mario actually wasn’t bad. 
The one I’d criticize if any, is Seth Rogen as Donkey Kong. In my opinion, that choice prevented the character of Donkey Kong from growing out of the Seth Rogen tendencies. 

One of my major criticisms is the choice to play hit songs at various moments. There is so much great music throughout the Mario world, fitting all moods and sceneries. This film could’ve been a great opportunity to showcase this type of music to audiences that never experienced the video games. And while some of the video game score is around, they are aggressively overshadowed by these hit songs that don’t fit in well. 

Another criticism is that this takes a very safe direction to only tailor to kids. I pretty much only enjoyed this film because I’m a Mario fan. I can’t imagine other adults enjoying it as much as me.
While I welcome more films from Nintendo, I personally don’t see myself watching this film again due to having no originality script-wise. 

I think it would be very interesting to compare this with <i>Barbie</i>. Both are A-list casted first films in legendary IPs tailored for children, but wouldn’t necessarily anger die-hard fans if executed badly. Both were hugely successful at the box office. (And personally I feel about equal with both). 
To contrast, <i>Barbie</i> made many risky choices to deviate from the source material’s goal and attempt to communicate a message to all audiences. Then, this film made no risky choices and really only tailored to children (and fans of the source material). 
Was this the right choice for each film? Would they have performed differently if they chose the other choices? How will Hollywood interpret this result for future films they produce?",,2023-09-25
2023-09-28,Ray,2004,https://boxd.it/4UeO0p,4,,"A solid biopic about the life of Ray Charles.

This follows basically all the typical tropes of a musical biopic. This is not a negative in any way - it's a successful formula, so might as well keep it around! 

I admittedly knew nothing about Ray Charles or his music going into this film. So more than anything, my personal takeaway was learning about his life and impact on the music world. Totally did not know that Jamie Foxx's portion of Kanye West's ""Gold Digger"" is from a Ray Charles song! 

Absolutely deserving Oscar win for Jamie Foxx. I did not see Jamie Foxx at all. All I saw was the actual Ray Charles throughout. 

What I did particularly appreciate was that Ray Charles wasn't treated with pity or acted that way. Given that he is a black man growing up in Jim Crow world and is blind, this film easily could've went a direction of showing how he suffered in life through this. But, likely mirroring the true Ray Charles, this never prevented him from pursuing his dreams. 

Like all musical biopics, the lead typically has many immoral vices (e.g. drugs, affairs). Ray Charles has the same. The film doesn't completely praise him as he does have many flaws. 

What did bug me was that there are many alterations from the real story that didn't need to occur. For example, apparently Ray did try saving his brother from drowning before his brother tragically died. In the film, it shows Ray simply watching his brother drown to death. I don't know why choices like this were made when there are real events to follow (that were arguably more gripping than what we actually saw).

A minor criticism is that this film is a bit longer than it should be and it's not always as investing as it could be. But, a strong Jamie Foxx performance along with infectious Ray Charles music makes this musical biopic above average.",,2023-09-27
2023-09-28,Renfield,2023,https://boxd.it/4UeOrZ,3,,"A silly time-pass elevated with a unique premise.

My biggest praise for this film is it's unique premise. They were able to get Nicolas Cage as Dracula. But rather than focusing on the character of Dracula, they make a risky choice of focusing on Dracula's servant. I strongly commend the filmmakers for taking such a risk. Overall I think it did pay off because I genuinely cared about Renfield's progression through the film.
That being said, I do wish we had more of Nicolas Cage's Dracula in the film because he was so good as Dracula.

The runtime is only 1.5 hours, which is the perfect runtime. It didn't overstay it's welcome, but didn't rush anything. 

What didn't always work for me was the shifting tones. It has comedic lines with over-the-top gore. But then it also has some fairly creepy looks that would've been amazing if it was a pure horror film. But by doing a little of both, I was confused on how seriously to take anything I was seeing.

Another thing that didn't work too well for me was that it followed many typical action/superhero movie tropes (e.g. third act battle). They struck gold with the casting and plot of Dracula's servant questioning his purpose in life. I would've loved to flesh that out more, instead of following plot tropes we've seen before.

I really wish we can get more movies like this, even if I'm not raving about the film. Many films tend to me super small indie budget or hundreds of millions of dollars with huge casts. I'm sure there's a big market of people interested to support mid-budget fun in theaters.

This didn’t do anything wrong per se. It’s just that there are many better versions of this type of film, where it be animated films or kids films or Ronald Dahl adaptations. The only reason to check this out is to complete the Steven Spielberg filmography. 

The visuals probably would’ve been great to see in theaters. But, it doesn’t translate that well to the tv screen. I just don’t think the motion capture worked so well with this setting because it was only for the giants and not the normal humans. The scene with the darkly lit tree was pretty though, but a film will need more than that to capture interest. 

With Spielberg as the director, I don’t necessarily expect perfection every time, but at least I expect charm. Spielberg is great at capturing emotional magic through his best films. Here, I just didn’t feel the emotional strings tugged enough. Other than a couple cool chase sequences and perspective shots, I would’ve believed that this was helmed by any other director. 
This overall just seemed like a direct adaption without providing any more depth. Kinda surprised that a lot of the scatological humor was kept, it wasn’t even executed that well.",,2023-09-28
2023-09-30,Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani,2023,https://boxd.it/4UYmvL,1,,"This is one of the worst mainstream Bollywood movies I’ve ever seen. I genuinely don’t understand how most viewers enjoyed this. For those that claimed “this is a classic like <i>Kuch Kuch Hota Hai</i>”… we must have seen completely different movies. 

I went into this film completely rooting for it. I genuinely enjoy most of the filmography Karan Johar, Alia Bhatt, and Ranveer Singh. With this combination, I could not imagine a negative reaction.
In addition, the prior generation actors of Dharmendra and Jaya Bhaduri were returning. I expected to feel charming nostalgia with their presence. 
Instead, I view this film as a gross tarnish of all their legacies. 

This felt like hot garbage immediately from the start. The production design of the opening number was all flash and no charm. I didn’t want to sing along with the song. This may sound like a nitpick, but Karan Johar is always consistent with making you feel like you’re in a cinematic event. And it didn’t happen here. 
The scenes afterward also felt really off. The jokes felt more cringey than humorous, and this unfortunately continued through the runtime. 
What I really hated was the amount of raunchiness. I’m not against raunchy jokes, but they should have the right amount and quality to fit the vibe of the film. There was so much of it in the film that I would not describe it as a family film. This was definitely not present in other “classics” like <i>Kuch Kuch Hota Hai</i>. 

The worst offense is that I hated main characters of Rocky and Rani. Both came off as bratty and narcissistic. 
Rani’s first scene shows off that she is a feminist calling out a politician’s crude behavior. The scene immediately after is Rocky and Rani’s first scene together. Rocky’s vibe was frankly disgusting with crude jokes and everything. Yet, Rani falls for him from the start. Makes no sense whatsoever. 
The film continues a message of women empowerment throughout. Of course I’m completely on board with a message like this. But what was terrible was how this message was executed. For example, there’s a moment when Rocky and Rani break up because Rocky wants to get married but Rani only viewed them as a non-committal physical-only fling. And Rani’s statement is supposed to be viewed as empowerment. If the genders were reversed in this situation and the man wanted the non-committal physical-only fling, it would’ve been viewed as objectifying. 

There’s a whole section of Rocky’s grandfather (Dharmendra) and Rani’s grandmother having a secret affair together. The film pushes a narrative that this is the right thing to do. I kept viewing it as gross elder abuse, and absolutely disrespectful to Rocky’s grandfather (Jaya Bhaduri). There was no attempt to even share to Jaya Bhaduri why then meeting up together is important for Dharmendra’s health. 
This sentiment kinda continued through the film. I was generally always on the side of Jaya Bhaduri’s character, but the film treats her as the villain and everyone else as the heroic activist. 

There were two moments in the film where I saw the Karan Johar Bollywood spark where I wished we saw more of. 
First was a scene where Rocky throws a reality check to Rani’s family, followed by a quote “he’s not perfect, neither are we”. I somehow almost felt emotional with this despite hating a lot of the characters. 
Second was the Bengali Durga Pooja celebrations. Everything was red and beautiful. It had a musical number that was actually respectful to the culture (and the only song I’d be willing to sing along with). Every other huge set piece in the film just felt flashy and fake. This one showcased beautiful Indian culture, the type of stuff that Bollywood needs to do more of to educate the world. 

To me, this gives me the same feeling as <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>. The entire world touts this story as “the greatest love story ever”. Once I actually read it, I had so many flaws with it. It seemed more like idiots having miscommunications instead of beautiful romance. And I have the same view with this film.

Knowing that this was created as stop-motion, that makes me give huge praise to the filmmakers to making something so seamless and beautiful. 
Unfortunately, I don’t know if such effort is really worth it for everyday audiences. No one will know it was made as stop-motion unless being explicitly told, because the animation combines stop-motion and CGI.

2023-10-06,Reservoir Dogs,1992,https://boxd.it/4WZM0f,4.5,,"Arguably the best feature-length directorial debut ever. 

This film is proof that a big budget is not necessary to create a groundbreaking experience. It’s a very simple story, but somehow felt more grounded than the production cost. This is due to the power of the screenplay. 
While the main part of the plot is a heist, we never witness the actual heist. Sure, this was likely due to budgetary reasons. But, we got to focus on an area that somehow felt even more interesting and unique - the mental effect of a heist on a group of criminals. This felt like a similar effect as Jaws - we felt the fear not from shark visuals, but from civilians fearing the shark. This is a spark that many big budget films fail to explore, and I wish they did. 

The nonlinear storytelling was executed effectively here. It wasn’t just a schtick. All the flashback moments felt like they had a purpose to be shared only at that point. At all points, I had no idea what direction the plot would go, and I was fully on the ride. 

Docking a half star because I felt there was unnecessary crude dialogue. I get that is one of Quentin Tarantino’s signatures. But, it felt better placed in his other features like <i>Django Unchained</i> and <i>The Hateful Eight</i> because those features occurred in past times when such dialogue was more commonplace. On the other hand, this film seemed set in present time (at the time of release), so the crude dialogue felt like it had no purpose.",,2023-10-05

I knew nothing about this film going into it. I spontaneously decided to watch it when I saw a thumbnail with a child Macaulay Culkin on Netflix. I then looked at rest of the talent and saw John Hughes and John Candy were involved. I was ready for vibes like <i>Home Alone </i>so I decided to hit play!
Side note - as much as I follow movie cast and crew, I still find myself in moments like this where I say “wait a movie with these people exist??”

Starting the film, you know pretty much immediately the type of movie it will be. You know that it will begin with a weird and obese character with terrible first impressions that actually turns out to have a lot of heart. Nothing wrong with that at all - we all enjoy getting tugged at the heartstrings. 

That being said, I ended up not actually feeling all that heartwarmed. Something just felt tonally off through it all. I thought this would be a nice kids movie, but it ended up having some strange dark undertones and PG-13 moments. By the end, I didn’t feel like Uncle Buck actually deserved better than what the movie wants us to believe. 

Uncle Buck’s character is introduced basically as a bachelor living alone as a pigsty with no experience in child care and never really bonded with his nieces and nephew. Yet, he is also very protective of them, gets along cutely with the younger ones, and knows how to counteract the rebellious teenager. I wish there was some more connective tissue on explaining why Uncle Buck would act this way given his background. 
That being said, there were some heartwarming parts with Uncle Buck here. His line on what made Macaulay Culkin brush his teeth was adorable. The fact that he cares about the safety of the rebellious teenager is heartwarming. 
On the other hand, Uncle Buck had moments where it was hard for me to side with him. He seriously hated the teenager’s boyfriend without much reason in the beginning. 
I get that what I’m asking for is to make this film way more “mainstream” and “expected”. The problem is that it didn’t commit to either direction, which then ended with a meh feel. 

Altogether, John Candy and Macaulay Culkin are household names for a reason - they have a great humorous charm, and it does exist in this film. It’s enough to warrant a recommendation, even if better versions of this film exist.",,2023-10-10

Admittedly, this is not at all my type of genre. I get the whole goal of movies like this is the unsettling journey, but I’d rather have joyous or suspenseful journeys rather than unsettling journeys. That being said, there were enough interesting ideas here to make me give it a recommendation. 

I have good appreciation for <i>Saw</i>. It’s one of many examples where low budget is not a deterrent to showcase something so unique. A lot of its charm was how simple the story and setting was. 

This film almost felt like Hollywood blindly throwing more money into a sequel of a successful film, but focusing the budget on weird parts. This film had much more stylized cuts and cinematic editing, which felt unnecessary for a genre like this. 

I wasn’t the biggest fan of some side characters in the film, especially most of the people stuck in the puzzle. They felt like annoying caricatures with a schtick and less of a believable human. 

The film really grew on me as the runtime passed. The puzzles became interesting and the twists were unexpected while still feeling consistent with the rules of the world.

I mainly watched this to review more of Ridley Scott's filmography - so far I have loved everything I watched of his. This is the first war film of his that I watched, so I was looking forward to see his take in this genre.

Full disclosure: I'm likely less positive than I normally would, only because I recently watched <i>Saving Private Ryan</i> for the first time - that may be the best war film I've ever seen, so I can't expect any other war film to even compare. 
<i>Saving Private Ryan</i> did a great job of making you feel like you were a fly on the wall in a brutal battleground. It had a real but simple story amidst the environment to keep you invested through the mess. 
In comparison, this story had more subplots and characters and cinematic nature. 

I do appreciate that this film exists, as it covers a war in Somalia in the 1990s. It doesn't have as much historical attention as, say, World War II, so at least audiences get awareness.

There were scenes that were pretty brutal. One death in particularly reminded me of a scene right after the Red Wedding in <i>Game of Thrones</i>. 

Interestingly, despite having cast members that I've definitely seen in other movies (e.g. Tom Hardy, Ioan Gruffudd, Ty Burrell, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Orlando Bloom), I genuinely didn't recognize any of them in this movie. Probably partially because this was filmed in 2001, so everyone was much younger than what I'm used to. But, I'll actually take it as a compliment to this film that I could engross with the characters without getting distracted by their real names.

Also, there are definitely jokes and characters that would be canceled if created in today's world.

What was refreshing here was that the character of Akeem was not a spoiled brat. Usually in a riches-to-rags story, you see the child continuously wishing for a wealthy like again (and the comedy roots from that). Here, Akeem wanted to step away from his spoiled family to experience the real world. So on that alone, he is much more likeable as a protagonist. 

It was a pretty good surprise to see James Earl Jones as a pretty ridiculous character, given that he is obviously known as very different roles like Darth Vader and Mufasa. Also a good surprise to see a certain cameo that I won't spoil.

This is a pretty good showcase of Eddie Murphy's talent, and all the characters were investing. But I don't consider this film to be an iconic comedy. A little too much silliness and incohesive nature prevents me from loving it more. I am curious enough to check out the recent sequel though.",,2023-10-18
2023-10-20,Joy Ride,2023,https://boxd.it/51xjln,4,,"A raunchy comedy that passes the assignment, and then some. 

It’s weird to review movies like these because the goal is just to have edgy comedy. I could criticize plot inconsistencies and conveniences, but these really don’t matter if I laugh enough and enjoy the journey. And that’s exactly what happened. 

This is definitely a hard R comedy, but I actually didn’t think the raunchiness was out of place. The jokes had enough wit to not feel tired. It was edgy enough without feeling disgusting. I wanted to keep seeing the four leads in ridiculous situations to see how they handle them. 

What surprised me was how much heart the film had. I’m usually tired of films that message the protagonist going through a demographically identity crisis because they occur so much (and it’s hard for me to buy into the fact that they suffer just because of their demographics). In contrast, I actually bought into the identity crisis that the main character had. Unlike most films, she didn’t come off as hating Chinese culture - she just initially doesn’t relate to it due to her upbringing with adopted American parents (as expected). So it was understandable what she was going through. 

The dysfunctional friendship between the four characters was also fun. Even if typical plot points of breakups and forgiveness occur, they are conducted in a relatable enough manner. 

I’m not giving this a perfect score, only because I personally wouldn’t rate this as a “must-see” in the vain of other comedies. Admittedly I can’t explain why. But I’m sure there is an audience out there that would love this enough to be their own “cult-classic”.",,2023-10-19
2023-10-20,Asteroid City,2023,https://boxd.it/51xjBF,4,,"Classic Wes Anderson.

I very recently discovered Wes Anderson, and immediately became a fan of his style. No matter what is happening in the film, I love the deadpan delivery and eccentric nature of the scenes. It makes me feel like a child again, but still having a sense of maturity and art. And while there are huge A-listers in the cast, Wes Anderson still manages to be the main highlight of his films.

Admittedly, the only other films of his I saw are <i>Moonrise Kingdom</i> and <i>The Grand Budapest Hotel </i>- I've heard these are his best, so I may have to temper my expectations when I discover his rest.

This film is incredibly beautiful. Production design and cinematography is bright and joyful. 

Amongst the huge A-listers in the ensemble cast, somehow Wes Anderson's style still shines with joy. Particularly, the banter amongst the child actors were my favorite moments. Steve Carell's side character moments were also fun.

I love the world here with people of all backgrounds coming together in this small town for a Junior Stargazer convention. That being said, I doubt I'll really remember the story that occurred in this film.

This film makes a choice of organizing it as a ""play inside a film"" rather than just a film about the Junior Stargazer convention in a small town. It's an interesting choice, but I don't really know what it contributed to this setting. I would've preferred just a film of this setting. 

Overall, this was a fun ride with Wes Anderson, and I'm willing to inflate my rating on that alone because the style makes an average story feel above average.",,2023-10-19
2023-10-23,Fast X,2023,https://boxd.it/52pTY9,2.5,,"A franchise that seems to be overstaying its welcome and unable to keep it's charm.

It is easy to nitpick this franchise to death because none of it makes sense. People that ""died"" in prior films are brought back to life through shoe-horned explanations. The rules of physics are thrown out the window. Despite all that, I can't help but appreciate the franchise for what it is. There's no denying that car chases are super fun. They really do crash all those cars while filming, and it definitely pays off with better quality thrill scenes. 

For me, the peak was in films 5-8 of the franchise. They had the right amount of ludicrous (no pun intended) while still having thrills. The number of characters in those films were at a reasonable amount, and the big budget scenes were at the right amount of wild. Oddly enough, the charm for me in these films are elevated when the characters actually seem serious, despite taking part in ludicrous action sequences.

F9 kinda lost me for its character choices. There was too much focus on family drama and not enough on brainless action. Also, the cast was inflated with many characters, so it felt like each person had to contractually receive certain lines and scenes and it didn't really stitch well together. 

I like this film more than F9, but it didn't have the same charm as films 5-8. There are even more characters in this film that seemed contractually obligated to exist, which led to many disconnected subplots. 

Jason Momoa's character choice was...odd. It felt like his character was a different movie from everything else. Despite the ludicrous action scenes, every other character still acts somewhat seriously. That juxtaposed with Jason Momoa's villain curtsying and painting the nails of his victims just felt odd. I would've loved to see this character in another film whose tone fits much better.",,2023-10-22
2023-10-23,John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum,2019,https://boxd.it/52pUcZ,3.5,,"A fun action thriller with above average action sequences.

I've generally been lower in my ranking for John Wick films compared to most critics. My personal cup of tea is I prefer the <i>Mission: Impossible</i> and <i>Extraction</i> films - those films have stories and action sequences that connect better with me. Admittedly, I've seen all John Wick movies thus far on a plane screen, which is a far from ideal setting for these films. Hopefully I can watch the 4th film on a bigger screen.

I was admittedly bored with the second film in this franchise, as it seemed to have a lot of talking and not enough enjoyable action. I liked this one much more than the second one - much more action all around. The second film also oddly drew me away from appreciating the world of the Continental, but this film drew me back into appreciating it. 

I love the beginning of this film - it picks up pretty much immediately from the end of the second film, and the gun fu is electric. There is also immediate tension with him on the run, so I was quickly invested on that alone.

Halle Berry and the dogs were a hugely welcome addition here. I only recall seeing frequent attack dogs in video games like <i>Call of Duty</i> and <i>The Last of Us: Part II</i> - this was the first I saw it happen in a film! Huge kudos to the stunt team.

The visuals around the fight scenes in the third act were also really fun. I was on board with all the dazzle here.

I liked this film enough to want to watch the fourth film. But, the story in this film (and the rest of the franchise) is still not as interesting to me as others in the action genre.",,2023-10-22

2023-10-29,Killers of the Flower Moon,2023,https://boxd.it/54Ckm9,3,,"I admittedly haven’t seen a lot of Scorsese’s filmography. I’ve been positive of everything I’ve seen this far (and <i>The Wolf of Wall Street</i> is one of my favorite films), but overall I actually don’t have much excitement about his films in the way that other directors excite me. I still do have huge respect for Scorsese - not everyone can have such a large film impact across many decades. 

My biggest praise for this film is the story and setting. It’s a unique setting that we don’t see much on film. It’s clear that a lot of close effort was put in to ensure the Osage tribe was depicted accurately. It’s a tragic story that I can’t believe actually occurred, and I’m glad this film brings awareness to it. 
Despite close effort put into the Osage tribe depictions and the production design of the 1920s, I weirdly couldn’t help but feel surprised at how easily I could understand the dialogue. I would’ve expected 1920s English to not sound as modern as it did. 

This film had a budget of $200 million. I genuinely do not understand how that was possible. Most films with high budget have visual effects spectacle where high budgets make sense. I saw none of that here. Sure, there were beautiful shots, but I’ve seen similar beautiful shots in films less than a quarter of the budget. I don’t see a reason to watch this film in theaters, you can watch it on TV and get the same effect. The only way I could believe this budget is if it included the salaries of Leonardo DiCaprio, Martin Scorsese, and Robert De Niro. 

This film also seriously did not need the 3.5 hour runtime. The same takeaways could’ve been communicated with under 3 hours. 
It should be a crime to show a film over 3 hours in theaters without an intermission to get a bathroom break and/or buy more snacks.",,2023-10-28

Unfortunately, it overstays its welcome, and doesn’t know how to manage the themes it shares. 

The film focuses on the heroine strictly wanting a baby without any strings attached from a father figure. Through the film, I kept going back and forth with how I felt of this characterization. Sometimes I felt it was unique, but it also sometimes came off as arrogant. Ultimately I came around to be fine with it based on how it ended, but it could’ve been explored better. 

My biggest negative is the amount of crude humor focused on the sperm donor process. It was out of place with everything else going on with the low-brow nature of the jokes. That time could’ve instead be used to tie up loose ends better than a quick line to resolution. 

The stand-up comedian aspect was actually brought forth very well. It was very accurate to how stand-up life is. The joy that comes from bringing laughter to others. Bringing personal thoughts into your set, and figuring out how to manage art from going over the top.",,2023-11-03
2023-11-05,Hook,1991,https://boxd.it/56ViuL,5,,"What a refreshing heartwarming film!

I was thoroughly surprised by this film. I watched this just to continue my attempt at completing the Spielberg filmography, and no other reason. The last “kids” movie of Spielberg I watched was <i>The BFG</i>, which disappointed me. 
This film had all the charm that I wish <i>The BFG</i> had. 

What a great concept - what if Peter Pan left Neverland and grew up and forgot he was Peter Pan?

I totally understand why kids that grew up with this film hold it so close to them. What surprised me was that adults at the time didn’t view it well. There’s so much to appreciate in this as an adult. 

Amongst the whim, there’s a lot of beautifully crafted aspects. John Williams’s score may be the best of his ever. All the emotional beats have proper setup and payoff. Despite the fairy tale nature, every character is realistic. 

Robin Williams is perfect casting here. He starts off as a believably serious workaholic, and turns into a whimsical child. Any other actor would look like a fool doing this. But this is right in the alley of an expressive comedian like Robin Williams.

What surprised me what how caught up I was in the emotional beats. The little kid recognizing Peter Pan by feeling his face. Peter getting his imagination back and views all the food around. Peter potentially losing his children. With the setup of the father not being there for his children, it’s completely believable that he could lose his children in Neverland. The fact that I almost welled up (and I’m not even a father), I’m sure every parent will feel emotional about this. 

I also actually really loved the production design of this film. It feels like a play, where each scene has a rolled out static set piece as you’d see in a Broadway show. While this could come off as “fake”, I felt that the characters were the ones that brought life to the scenes and settings. 
This also brought an opportunity to shine minor smart choices (e.g. a gun that holds a live chicken creating eggs in real time). 

Sure, I could aggressively nitpick this film. The scene of three mermaids kissing Peter Pan underwater is very random. Tinker Bell’s size growth was weird. There are cheesy lines throughout. A brighter color grading could’ve added more joy. But overall, this film hit all the highs so well and still holds up. It could’ve been a rebooted tale of Peter Pan, but it’s new tale that is faithful to the source material while sharing something new. This film makes me believe that any film concept can shine as long as you have the right creative team.  

Spielberg apparently looks back on this film negatively, but I don’t think he should. I think it’s one of his best!",,2023-11-04
2023-11-05,Jawan,2023,https://boxd.it/577HYv,1.5,,"Sigh. 

This movie tries to be so many things at once, and can’t commit to executing any of them properly. 

The one positive I have are with the action sequences. <i>Pathaan </i>had very bad CGI and badly directed action sequences. Here, the action sequences were directed way better. They were thrilling and epic. I could only tell they were fake when observing closely to nitpick. They defied the laws of physics, but it’s set up well enough to understand that it’s not trying to be believable action. 

I’m not against Shah Rukh Khan still playing roles like this at his age, but I wish he could have love interests that are at least closer in age to him. The obvious age difference just feels low key creepy. I just fast forwarded all the songs because I didn’t care about seeing the awkward chemistry (and none of them are good songs).  
As creepy as this kept feeling, I do have to acknowledge that he has superstar natural charm. And it shows in this film. 

There are a lot of political themes and messages that are important to highlight. But none of them were realized well enough as they deserve. I wish they just focused on one, rather than saying yes to all of them. 

It seems that Hindi films are starting to try imitating Telugu film formats. Hiring Telugu and Tamil cast members definitely alludes that. But, they seem to be imitating the wrong parts (e.g. “masala” format without properly realizing all subplots).

I typically don’t like comparing a film to prior films from the same folks (e.g. Pixar, a certain director). A film that normally could be great may not get the credit it deserves because people feel “it’s not as good as the other films”. The worst offenses of this were Unbreakable and The Village by M. Night Shyamalan being criticized simply by comparison to The Sixth Sense and Signs, respectively. 
Pixar has had a near perfect track record. Sure, we can debate if they are not in their prime anymore, but we shouldn’t say a film is bad just because it’s “not as good as Toy Story”. 

I had a great time watching this film. I felt the intended emotional beats. The world of elements felt sufficiently explored. Arguably the most beautiful animation I’ve seen - not everything was just the typical Pixar blob. Each element (particularly Fire and Water) kinda had their own animation style that was appreciated. I bought into the romantic chemistry between the leads. I absolutely loved the musical score of this film - I found myself humming the tunes few days after watching it. 

If this film was released during the “prime Pixar years”, I’m sure this would’ve received much more appreciation than it is now. 

As for criticisms, the humor could’ve been smarter. There were many “dad jokes” with elements - while this is definitely my type of humor, more wit into the jokes would’ve been appreciated. 
There were many jokes in reference to “pruning” which felt really odd to me.",,2023-11-07

The problem is that those time periods are so far behind today, so it’s difficult for me to relate to content of that time period. Also, in general films are less flashy and slower paced compared to what we are used to today. 

I will hugely praise this film for forming the setting of the city Casablanca. The set design and extras all were diverse and felt lived in. That seems difficult to replicate in that time period. 

It is also hugely impressive that a film set in World War II was released during World War II, even before the US was involved with the war. Very fascinating fun fact that this film was rushed to release to capitalize on the publicity of the ongoing war - I frankly can’t expect a film today to make a release decision like this. 

Definitely many sweet moments and suspenseful moments. I could see myself thoroughly enjoying this film at the time of release. I understand why this film is iconic in film history. 

I really like the concept of the film - romantic and political drama set around refugees. Everything about that is fascinating.

I’ve always wanted more movies like <i>Home Alone </i>- that movie is truly viewable by all ages. No blatant attempts for merchandising, simply fun for all audiences. It has appropriate humor, charm, and tension. 
Now, I can say this film is also another in that genre. 

The chemistry amongst the child actors was the best part of the film. It didn’t feel like adults wrote their lines; it truly felt like kids being kids with their immature curiosities and adventurous natures. If this same plot existed with young adults on the journey, I doubt it would have been successful. 

While everything about this setting is ludicrous (e.g. an entire unexplored underground area, criminal masterminds being thwarted by children), it also has the charm to keep you invested. 

It was a lot of fun watching currently well known actors as children back then, still having strong screen presence (Josh Brolin, Sean Astin, and especially Ke Huy Quan).

This concept could get so chaotic. Or even go a discomforting route that explores the ethics of mind control (similar to blood-bending in <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i>. I still get chills thinking about this)

Unfortunately, the execution is messy. 

We are brought forth with Ben Affleck as a cop trying to find the person that made his daughter go missing. This is a typical premise that is interesting enough for a crime drama. But, it didn’t gel with a world of mind controllers.

I remember when I saw the first trailer for this movie, I was extremely excited about it - all the jokes in that trailer landed for me. The negative reviews after it detracted me from seeking it out, and also I slowly lost a charm for Melissa McCarthy. 

My biggest praise for this film is how seamlessly all the puppeteering was filmed. I was completely focused on the film’s plot that I didn’t even think about how the puppets were filmed. Apparently all the scenes had puppeteers, which were removed from the camera through a combination of CGI and strategic camera directions. And the on-screen humans had to walk in certain thin paths while acting their parts to ensure they weren’t in the way of puppeteers. This almost feels like the effort that went into The Lord of the Rings trilogy. 

However, this ultimately was just another typical Melissa McCarthy comedy. The jokes went cheap routes when they could’ve easily gone wittier routes. The screenplay wasn’t bad, but it was just a typical crime. 

I also felt the statements of “systemic racism” between humans and puppets was overdone. I think it was trying to make statements about it, but didn’t do enough with it to make much of a conclusion. So overall it just came off as neither here nor there.",,2023-11-11

This is what I wish more comedy films could be like. Mainstream comedy films nowadays go for raunchy humor - while there’s a market for this, I think there’s also a market for clean adult humor. 

They really nailed the choices for the two lead characters. Having one person with a short temper alongside an oddball just writes itself. We all naturally want issues to be resolved in films, but in this case we keep wanting them together to get more humor out of their “antichemistry”. 

I also appreciate that this is a thanksgiving film - we don’t really see much of those. Anything else holiday related is always Christmas. May have worked for this film’s benefit because it’s now known as the classic thanksgiving film!

Loved every bit with John Candy selling shower rings. Such a minor object that can sell so well when matched with the perfect salesman!

A fun fact I learned after watching was that in one of the scenes where Steve Martin was laughing, that was actually genuine laughter as he was thinking of prior scenes. And the filmmakers happened to be filming that, so it was used in the film. I totally buy that, because his laughter in that scene seemed so genuine and infectious. 
There are various minor details sprinkled throughout the film that really enhance the film because they show how much thought the filmmakers put into continuity for a laugh-out-loud comedy. For example, in the first plane detour, Steve Martin calls his wife while John Candy calls a hotel. This typically would be such a forgotten moment, but once you learn a detail at the film’s ending, it’s consistent with this minor moment. 

Despite the film going generally predictive routes, the film manages to still feel heartfelt in the end. 

I came away at the end of the movie kinda wishing we could get more humorous screen time with the two leads. But, all the screen time we got was great quality, so I could see how more of it could potentially lessen the charm.

Sidebar - I watched this film while on an international flight journey while I had many travel jitters with fear of delayed/canceled flights.

This was also a good recontextualization of Rocky IV. While I enjoyed that film, it did have a weirdly shoehorned pro-America anti-Russia sentiment. This film followed up on the best parts of that storyline with serious tones from both sides. 

As usual, the casting and performances are perfect here from Sylvester Stallone and Michael B. Jordan. 

Fights scenes were stellar, I genuinely felt like the actors were actually getting severely injured. While it didn’t have the most investing fight sequences compared to the best in the franchise, they were solid enough. 

I think my only criticisms are that I think other films in this franchise have better versions of what we saw here. It didn’t really feel fresh or add anything new to the franchise.

Idris Elba was the perfect choice as a villain.  It’s a difficult task to assign anyone against Dwayne Johnson and Jason Stratham and have a believably fair fight. Idris Elba was a believable villain in this, both by tone and opposite these macho actors. 

The car scenes had the right amount of ludicrous as the park of the franchise, something that I feel later entries in the franchise are losing. 

It was refreshing to have something in the fast universe that wasn’t with Vin Diesel’s family storylines. While this franchise is known for goofy titles, this one is perfect for the tone that this film is.

During and immediately after this film, I was ready to rate it as one of the worst films to exist. I felt headaches of stress through it all, waiting for the runtime to be over. Nothing followed logical convention, and I had no clear understanding of what to expect or who to root for. 

Upon reflection, I started appreciating it a little bit more. It does take balls to make something this crazy, so kudos to Ari Aster for actually executing it. The performance of Joaquin Phoenix is very commendable, he is deserving of awards consideration. I did not see the actor, but I saw someone with huge anxiety really needing aid. 
I also watched Chris Stuckmann’s review where he showed his take that the film is an inside view of what living with anxiety feels like. I could see many relate to this take.

If you know me, you know I have a huge obsession with SpongeBob. But in my defense, many people around my age do too, so that goes to show that there is something to respect with this IP. 
The true fans also know that the peak of the IP was from the first episode to when the first theatrical film was released. This timeframe was when they nailed the humor and charm, and formed many iconic lines still repeated by us all today. 
After this, the writers seemed to focus on gross-out and weird humor, which detracted many from continuing. 

Personally, I’d rate the second film positively because it did have moments of charm and humor like its prime. But I will admit that it also had many moments of weirdness (and even some annoyance). 

I can gladly share that this film has the consistent SpongeBob charm and humor through the whole runtime. It felt like watching a classic SpongeBob episode, which is the best compliment I can share. 

As much of a purest I am, I did appreciate the new 3D animation style here. It felt like it had its own unique art style, and not just copying what the majority of animation studios do. 
I was pleasantly surprised and content with all the human appearances in the film. They were the right amount of weird to be acceptable within this film. 

Unfortunately I was not a fan of the ending. I was onboard with all the setup (plot, new and old characters to include, premise). But the ending seemed to be very quickly shoehorned together, and I wish it was fleshed out better to get to this point. 
It feels weird to point this out for a SpongeBob thing because it rarely matters for quality of SpongeBob episodes. But here, I felt it was so oddly paced at the end that it took me aback.

2023-11-27,Past Lives,2023,https://boxd.it/5e8uDf,5,,"This may be the best romance film I’ve ever watched. 

Don’t get me wrong, I will happily watch rom-coms. There’s a “typical male attitude” with rom-coms of “they all follow the same predictable plot lines and conveniences” - I disagree. My counter argument is that all genres have their own conventions. Action and superhero movies also follow the same formula and depend on many conveniences to buy into the film. 
That being said, I welcome takes that defy the typical genre conventions. And this film does it very well. 

The best praise I have is that it feels mature. Most romantic films have a focus on the flash and sex appeal - the leads are cast as attractive people and the romantic depth is shown through physical attraction rather than long-term communal strength. 
In contrast, this film had a maturity in the relationships. All conversations felt like they would actually occur with real people. Decisions were made logically. 

This film shows that it’s possible to display a compelling love story that focuses on the important parts of romance.",,2023-11-26
2023-11-27,The Last Samurai,2003,https://boxd.it/5e8uXz,3.5,,"Another solid entry in Tom Cruise’s filmography! 

We have a unique time period setting of the 1880s here. Normally I wouldn’t get excited about this time period, but the production design and cinematography was solid to keep this exciting. 

This seems to not have much praise due to following a “white savior narrative” with a plot similar to <i>Avatar</i>. I highly disagree with this. The plot literally begins with Tom Cruise’s character about to die, but is then spared by the samurai army. I never felt that it was Tom Cruise being the sole reason for anything positive occurring in the village. 

This film surprisingly doesn’t have as much action sequences, with most scenes focusing on the culture of the village and Tom Cruise’s assimilation. I think this was a smart move to bring uniqueness, but I couldn’t help but want more action. 

Everything about this film is done well, and I’m sure it would’ve been a great theater experience at the time. Since its release, we have seen many epic battle films, and I don’t think this film stands out well enough amongst the others we have. 

I still recommend because it is very competently crafted, has beautiful cinematography, and solid performances. Of all films that take place in the 1880s (if there are that many), I will prefer this one the most.",,2023-11-26

I knew nothing about this movie going into it, it was just thrown on the TV when I was with other people. 

It started off with a great premise. A person is down on his luck, then learns that stealing can be very easy from the elderly. And then this person who is new to the stealing world learns how complicated the world is from street beggars. 
I thought this film would explore how these stealers got into such situations, why they chose to go immoral routes, and how much guilt they feel from particularly stealing from the elderly. Juxtapose with this, an awkward older person not having purpose in life anymore and wishing the stealer would kill him. So much humor in that, and we saw some of it in the beginning. 
Instead, we got many other plot directions. A random love story between two old people that start bonding over the fact that they got stolen from. Amongst many other unnecessary plot directions. 

I wish this could be recreated again, with a much smaller screen time and committing to the premise it started with.",,2023-12-11
2023-12-15,Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,2023,https://boxd.it/5knNe3,2,,"Full disclosure - I’m not the biggest fanboy of the Indiana Jones franchise. Before the internet hates me for this, let me explain. 
I agree with the internet that this should’ve just been a trilogy because <i>Last Crusade </i>had a great ending. I agree that these films are a great showcase for the talent of Steven Spielberg. 
There are aspects I appreciate in all the four prior films. All have at least one action sequence that is thrilling to watch. All have a fun sense of adventure. 
I don’t hate the fourth film as much as everyone else, but I was really not a fan of shiny/digital appearance. The prior films felt dirty and lived in, while the fourth felt fake. That being said, I think the fourth film would’ve been received much more positively if people didn’t have the comparison to prior movies in the franchise. 
The main parts that take me away from loving the prior films is that all turn into a supernatural direction to an extent. My favorite adventure films are ones that can feel like they exist in the world (e.g. I accept superhero logic when built upon a premise of a superhero world). But the Indiana Jones world feels like it should just be real world, so the supernatural aspects don’t gel perfectly for me. 

Despite my history with the franchise, I was actually excited about this film. The crew seemed like a perfect meld. Harrison Ford and John Williams were both back. While I would’ve loved to see a Steven Spielberg vision, I was very excited with the choice of James Mangold. He is a strongly underrated director that has been involved in many different genres. Also, all the supporting cast (especially Mads Mikkelsen) was exciting. 

Now onto how I feel of the fifth film. I think this is not only the worst in the franchise, but unfortunately doesn’t really stand well on its own either. 

The biggest issue for me was the choices with an old Indiana Jones. I have no problem with an 80 year old Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones. But, the film chose to give him cranky old guy vibes. Then, he’s also involved in action sequences, but they can’t be physically intense because the actor is too old to handle that. 
I think there could’ve been a great story where Indiana Jones still has huge childish joy with adventure but not have it be as physically taxing. 

Next, I was not a fan of the sidekick. There is no problem with a sidekick that has “negative” aspects (e.g. rude, butts heads with the protagonist, makes decisions without much thought). In fact, prior installments in this franchise all had a sidekick like that. But unlike prior installments, this sidekick is messily set up so it’s hard to root for her or even understand her motivations. She also flip flopped a lot between caring for and not caring for Indiana Jones, which didn’t make sense. Normally this wouldn’t be a huge issue, but she makes a huge choice in the third act that that could only fit if the character motivation was clearer. 

Then, the villain. Made Mikkelsen felt strongly underutilized. The character’s motivation makes sense, but the film took a lot of time to fully show it. If more of this motivation was explained earlier, we could’ve felt fear from the character earlier. 

The first scene was my favorite part of the film. Everyone keeps focusing on the bad de-aging CGI, but the scenes itself were cool so the de-aging personally was not an issue to me. 

This film was much longer than it should’ve been. I will accept long runtimes if there is value in it (e.g. multiple intense action sequences in <i>Mission: Impossible 7</i>). Here, all the scenes felt padded, and action sequences were so low quality that they even felt boring. 

Without spoilers, there is a glimpse of a risky choice in the third act for how the franchise could end. I was fully on board with this, it would’ve made great sense for the character. But, the film chooses to not go that path and instead end in the “safe” manner. 

Despite my hatred for how fake and unexciting the action sequences looked, I could believe that they can actually occur in real life. There wasn’t as much supernatural vibes through scenes that didn’t need them - I can’t say this about any of the other films in the franchise. 

I really don’t understand how this film could cost $300 million to make. Every action scene felt so fake. With the same budget, we had a Mission: Impossible movie this year where action scenes were strongly believable and investing. There was a huge misuse of budget here somehow. 

I can’t help but think there’s a version of this film where James Mangold had more creative control. 

As much negativity as put in this review: I don’t think this is terrible. Everything is competently made. I don’t think this film is insulting to the legacy of Indiana Jones, and I don’t hate that this film exists. It’s just that there are many better modern action/adventure films out there.",,2023-12-14
2023-12-16,The Firm,1993,https://boxd.it/5kHk3Z,4,,"I’m really enjoying my watches of early Tom Cruise, they are both great movies and great performances from him!

I knew nothing about this movie going into it. I just picked it on Netflix because (a) it was leaving Netflix soon and (b) it had Tom Cruise. Picking a film without knowing anything can either be amazing or terrible. In this case, it was the positive one. 

My favorite part of it is how unique the premise is, and that it is executed in a thrilling manner. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a premise with an overbearing company on its employees. This premise alone could’ve been a boring Oscar bait film. Instead, this is shown as an adrenaline rush. This takes a lot of skill given the company is a law firm with boring suits and job descriptions. 
It admittedly has a more horror feel when watching today, given that technology makes it much harder to have a private life. I wonder if any tech companies provide this overbearing feel on their employees….
The execution almost came off in a soap opera feel. While normally I hate that, here it fit very well. The film starts with the main couple assimilating into a new town with the new job. There are unsettling minor details sprinkled here that are clear to the viewer, but not obvious to the protagonist drinking the koolaid. This smartly makes the viewer nervous for the protagonist, while also understanding why he makes decisions that would be different from the viewer. 

I acknowledge that this film is adapted from a book, but I think it’s still worth praising the film because it does take skill to have such feelings portrayed in a film and have it adapted faithfully enough. 

Strongly impressed with how this film still feels thrilling in today’s standards. Modern films seem to rely on visual effects to inject thrill, but this film shows that a compelling story and characters are enough. 

A couple pacing issues and subplot choices prevent me from falling in love with the movie. It’s also could easily shave off about 20 minutes of runtime. But, this is definitely great enough to recommend!

Pretty cool to see a Tom Cruise/Ed Harris film from 1986, since they are reunited together in 2022 in <i>Top Gun: Maverick</i>.",,2023-12-15
2023-12-17,X,2022,https://boxd.it/5l7e5x,3,,"An above average slasher film.

Slasher films are typically not my style, because I don’t really find enjoyment in seeing cool kills. I find more enjoyment when they focus on the suspense and tension. I won’t completely discount the genre because they can be great - the best example is Ridley Scott’s <i>Alien</i>. 

I spent most of the runtime not knowing the direction the film was going, so that is praiseworthy. 

It was also a funny setup to have pornographic filmmakers in 1979. Seems to be right around the time when the pornographic industry was expanding to more than just images. Funny lines around people trying to make it big in an industry that isn’t supposed to have much “depth” for its consumers. It also had some interesting commentary around how to separate the work and life of an actor in the industry. 
In addition, Without spoiling anything, the setup also led into some good exploration with the villains. 

Huge praise for Mia Goth. I knew she received praise for this film, and I admittedly initially didn’t think much of it. I then subsequently learned she had a double feature in this film. The fact that I didn’t even realize that goes to show how much variety she was able to have within the same film. 

This might have been the first time in a while that I saw a horror movie on a television in darkness - I had slight fear on the night drive home afterwards. So in that way, this film did its job. 

I was not a fan of how darkly lit the film was. In a way it’s “realistic”, but it got to the point where I was definitely missing some details. 

I also personally didn’t really enjoy the journey of the film too much (other than not really knowing the direction would go). Visuals were more gross than my personal taste. There was more pornographic-related discussions and scenes than what I would’ve wanted exposure to. Some scenes went through typical horror tropes, even though the film seemed it could easily be smarter than that.",,2023-12-16

I don’t really get why this has a cult following. There were a couple parallel subplots, with most not having much purpose. I understand that I shouldn’t expect everything to have a purpose, but they should at least have a fun journey. And I didn’t feel that way. Most scenes just felt like its purpose was shock humor. 

The main aspect that made me appreciate this film amongst the everyday coming-of-age films is the character of Stacy. Without spoiling anything, she had a great character arc that was believable and provides an important lesson to other people of that age. 

It’s funny that this film is regarded as an early Nicolas Cage film. In my first watch, I didn’t know what character he was. I then googled it and saw a frame with him, and still didn’t recall when that occurred. I then googled the exact timestamp and went to the spot - he was literally in a single frame in the film.

2023-12-22,Scarface,1983,https://boxd.it/5n41zL,5,,"I might like mobster movies now…

Mobster is one of the genres that used to not connect with me well for some reason. I think this is because I watched them before I was as passionate about film. Now, I will cite this film as the “gateway” into the mobster genre. 

This film was gripping from start to finish, even on today’s conventions. 

I couldn’t help but feel many parallels to <i>Breaking Bad </i>(but not in a bad way). We start out thinking the protagonist generally follows positive intentions (e.g. scenes that show his love for his family). But gradually, we start to see that he truly is a dark and crazy man underneath (e.g. unfazed with death around him). 

This was one of the few recent films I watched where the >150 minute runtime was actually justified. We witness the growth from nothing to a giant empire. Scenes were properly crafted to show motivations, and the timeframe was appropriate to display the work needed to obtain that growth. 

Al Pacino’s performance here was stellar. I haven’t seen much of his work, but this film makes me want to explore more of his filmography. 

Many iconic lines and references came from this film, and in the past I did not catch any of them. Now, I’m happy that I will understand those references. In addition, I will say that those lines are epic so they do justify a cult following.",,2023-12-21

There really isn’t much “wrong” with this movie, but there are better straight-to-Netflix movies of this type available. 

My favorite part was the vineyard culture - hearing people passionate about proper wine-making generated infectious laughter. 

I couldn’t help but feel like this was very clearly generated by either ChatGPT or a group of studio executives. It has the token leads, token side characters, family-loving quotes, expected third-act misunderstanding, and so on. Again, none of this is committed offensively, but it felt stitched together by an assembly line instead of by screenwriters with creative freedom.

2023-12-24,Rain Man,1988,https://boxd.it/5nCSST,4.5,,"Many years later, still heartwarming. 

We know exactly how a premise like this will end, but as long as the journey is enjoyable that’s all that matters. And this journey was very enjoyable. 

Many reviews mention that this portrayal of an autistic savant is very inaccurate, and is not representative of people with autism. Fair criticism, but I think most audiences can accept what’s going on in the movie for the sake of the movie while not caring too much about accuracies. 
On the flip side, apparently this film was credited for bringing awareness to autism, which is in general a great thing. 

Once again, I’m astounded by the dramatic performances of OG Tom Cruise. His relationship to Dustin Hoffman’s character reminded me a lot of <i>The Intouchables</i>, which I thought was a proper personality choice. He’s not a perfect character, but his moments of care for Dustin Hoffman’s character were believable. I think Tom Cruise deserved an Oscar nom here. One of the final scenes admittedly made me emotional with his performance - maybe because I thought of my own relationship with my brother as I was watching this. 

Obviously Dustin Hoffman was also great here, well deserving of his Oscar win. Although, I couldn’t help but wish the actor was actually someone with autism rather than an actor acting with autism. This probably would’ve happened if the film was made today. 

There are a couple minor details that prevent me from granting a perfect rating. Some side plots could’ve been removed. Some of the autistic bouts almost felt like they were conveniently placed to allow certain story beats to occur. 

There is a scene that essentially explains why the film has its title. I went through a mindblown experience when it revealed itself - very smart!

The best part is the premise - love the idea of a Christmas decorating contest going way more seriously than it should. I’m surprised this hasn’t been done on a mainstream level before. 

Eddie Murphy brings some great charm here, but it doesn’t save the film.

I had literally no idea this movie existed. I watched it out of recommendation from my brother. It was apparently nominated for an Oscar for visual effects. Then I realized it was released in the year 2020 - the year that movies barely existed. 

Definitely an imperfect film, but this offered a lot of enjoyment. I wish they waited on this release until post-pandemic, because I think many more could’ve appreciated it and give it a cult following. 

My favorite part is that while it may have a “conventional” feel, a lot of risks were taken. It’s a post-apocalyptic setting, but it feels more like a teenage rom-com that happens to take place in a post-apocalyptic setting. With the amount of effort that went into fleshing out the setting and the monsters, a typical studio would’ve used this as setup for a franchise. But instead, this was maintained as a contained teenage rom-com. The protagonist could’ve been a macho dude with some flaws that then experiences growth, but instead he is introduced as a straight up weakling. 

This definitely would not get a visual effects Oscar nomination in a “normal” year, but they were definitely commendable for the film that this was.

The standout performances for me were from Pam Grier, Robert Forster, and Samuel L. Jackson. 

As with all Tarantino films, this one plays a little bit with time. I usually don’t like this when other filmmakers do it, but I love it when Tarantino does it and this is no exception.

2024-01-01,Gran Turismo,2023,https://boxd.it/5srUq1,4.5,,"A unique sports drama that excels at all the thrilling and emotional beats.

The best part is the concept. A video game player turning into a professional athlete is still wild to me. I had no idea that Gran Turismo actually created a competition like this. It's also super cool that the real athlete was closely involved with the creation of this film and even worked as a stunt double.
I admittedly wasn't on board with this concept at first. But, Orlando Bloom's character shared an inspiring speech at the beginning to buy into the concept of a video gamer becoming an athlete, and this immediately allowed me to accept the premise.

The visuals are absolutely beautiful. I believed that all racers were actually in danger. The occasional editing choices with video game-like visuals were a uniquely fun addition.

I celebrated along with Jann every time he accomplished something, and felt sad whenever he had a setback. I believed all the physical and mental growth he gained through the film.

There is one scene between Jann and his father (played by Djimon Hounsou) that was humorous and emotional in all the right ways. 

It is surprising that this film was directed by Neill Blomkamp because this film is a completely different genre from his past works. Usually when this happens, it's done for the sake of getting a quick paycheck and allowing a lot of studio interference to occur. But here, I felt there was a lot of great creative choices from the director that a quick paycheck job would not have done. I can't wait to see more from this director, and I hope studios allow more filmmakers to make genre pivots like this.

I have many flaws due to the amount that the film resorted to conventional sports drama norms (which I will get into soon), but the highs of this film are so high that the lows don't set it back too far for me.

My list of flaws:
Jann's parents should've had more of an inclusion in the film. Given that the film shows the parents as closely caring for Jann, it's odd that they don't even show up in person to some of his races.
In addition, Jann's dad should've had more of the emotional support rather than focusing on David Harbour's support.
The romance subplot seriously did not need to exist. Not much chemistry there, and all the emotional weight that the filmmakers thought would come from this could've instead come from the parents.
There is an emotional scene between Jann and David Harbour's character that covered the backstory of David Harbour's character. The scene was properly emotional. But realistically, this character is an athlete, so Jann easily could've looked up his backstory at any point rather than being shocked by hearing about it in this moment.

Overall, I wish I saw this in theaters. I also wish more people watched this film in theaters.

I’ve always loved Octavia Spencer and she’s had well-deserved praise from all her other films, but this film really showcased to me how talented she is. This film is so out of her league, it’s like this film just doesn’t deserve her talent. 
I’ve never seen a creepy side to her, and wow was she very creepy. 

The first half of this film was actually solid for me, I was ready to rate it my best score. All the high schoolers behaved believably - of course a free hangout spot for alcohol is attractive. The unsettling moments were heightening in the right ways. The character of Ma had the right amount of mystery to be curious what drives her motivations. 

The second half unfortunately derailed heavily. Character choices became very inconsistent - for example, a person was very scared of Ma in one scene, and then oddly not scared anymore in the next. There were many moments where the film could’ve just ended with a quick 911 call, but they avoid that direction with stupid character choice. The last scene is absolutely bad shit crazy in the stupidest ways.

However, I’ve never really aligned well with what tends to the be on the “best of the year” lists. Some are amazing to me, most feel like overrated Oscar bait. It’s also odd to me that most of these “best of the year” films are released at the end of the year along with Oscar campaigns, like we’re supposed to expect that these will be one of the best films to watch. Then we totally forget about it after awards season. 
All to say - this is the mentality I go into when watching Oscar bait films like this one. 

As I was watching this film, I genuinely really hated the journey due to its gross subject matter, and an odd appearance that all the characters refer to this huge age-gap relationship as just a fact that exists and not as disturbing. My immediate thought was that there should be less films like this in the world, and more films around actual entertainment.  

Admittedly, I found myself thinking about this film days after the watch. I found myself reading upon the real life story that this film is loosely based on. I appreciated the choice of incorporating a method actor in the mix, as it showed the dangers of method acting. I then also understood the perspective of child who experienced abuse but didn’t really grasp it as abuse until the events that we see in the film. All in all, it was a unique choice to not focus on the events of child abuse, but focusing on ramifications of a child abuse episode many years later. 
All of these juxtaposed together are very risky choices that somehow work together well, mainly due to great acting across the board. 

Still, I do not recommend watching this movie. I’d rather feel unsettled in horror, rather than unsettled in child abuse drama. Most people will not relate to these characters. 
I guess the best praise I can give this film is that I can understand this film getting awards buzz (just given how film awards bs goes).

2024-01-05,The Creator,2023,https://boxd.it/5v2aAh,4.5,,"A thoroughly refreshing original sci-fi world!

This is the type of film we need to see more of, and the type of film that audiences need to support in theaters. 

The best part of this film is undoubtedly the world-building. The film begins with a lot of exposition about the rules of the world, but it didn’t feel like an exposition dump. In fact, quite the opposite. The entire look of the film was so unique that I was looking forward to learn more about it. Through the film, certain actions take place (e.g. transferring brain into some sort of thumb drive to be experienced through a machine) which are fascinating and totally make sense in this world. I genuinely believed I lived in a world where AI technology existed for many years (e.g. temple architecture crafted with AI entities). 

Visuals are absolutely breathtaking. Here is proof that huge budgets are unnecessary to get immersed. <i>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny </i>apparently had a budget over three times this one, but this film had way more believable set pieces and action sequences. 

I genuinely do not understand the criticisms that this film is derivative of many other sci-fi plots. Maybe if I squint I could find some similarities, but I feel like I’m just pulling at strings when I do that. The world is so unique and unlike other films I’ve seen, so that alone made my experience very positive. 
Most films that tackle AI show how terrible it is and that it must be stopped. Without spoiling much, we get perspectives here that are much more of a gray area (despite an entire AI war going on). So that goes to show that there is uniqueness offered in the film. 

Performances from Madeleine Yuna Voyles and John David Washington were amazing, and truly elevated this film. 

My only criticism was that especially in the second half, there are many conveniently timed actions to allow certain plot points and sequences to occur. 

I also will note there were cases where I totally missed some lines of important dialogue so I didn’t fully follow how certain plot points occurred. I don’t fault the film for this, I personally do this very often *facepalm*",,2024-01-04

I was surprised with how engrossed I was in this movie, despite lacking much action or fast pace. It’s also very admirable, considering that most of the film is just voiceover. 

I think what I really appreciated was that I got to see a completely different perspective to a character we see a lot of in action movies. We see the whole process that goes into a killer preparing for a murder, and not just the murder. In a way, this is a perfect fit for David Fincher since he is such a methodical director too. 
I also really like that the overall plot and premise was kept pretty simple. More complexities would’ve removed the charm for me. 

The film somehow also gets away with not requiring much character background explanation to feel invested. We are told just enough information about the characters, and yet at the same time we don’t want to learn more because the mystery is more captivating. 

This film also had a lot of dark comedy that really landed well for me. 

I think most people would be disappointed with this film because they expect a lot of action based on the title alone. 

My only complaint is that some scenes went on a bit longer than I would’ve liked. In a way I guess the long scenes are “accurate” because killers are supposed to wait until the right time for a murder. But as a viewer, this was still something that caught my attention.",,2024-01-05
2024-01-07,The Lighthouse,2019,https://boxd.it/5wc4uV,4,,"A surprisingly fun and scary contained film. 

I admittedly had low expectations going into this one. The premise seemed boring to me, and the black-and-white choice added to me feeling uninterested. I chose to give it a shot because I absolutely loved another film this director created - <i>The Northman</i>. 

My biggest praise is how many risks this film took. It’s a black-and-white, nearly square aspect ratio, set before the 1900s, and only has two cast members in a lighthouse. Despite all these “restrictions”, there was so much to explore in the world. I never felt like this was an actually old film, because it was paced well and had a lot of stimulus going on. 
I also don’t think that any of these choices were just checkboxes to stand out; they actually enhanced the best parts of the film. For example, light from a lighthouse feels even more blinding with just the contrast from black and white compared to what can be done with color. I really appreciate filmmaking that goes outside of conventions with a purpose. 

Another thing that worked for me well is the time period choice. It allowed me to be *more accepting* of barbaric and crazy actions. If this was a modern setting, uncivilized natures wouldn’t make as much sense to me. Also, this time period brought the best vocabulary from the lines of Willem Dafoe, which was so funny to watch. 

This film does the best job I’ve seen of blending comedy with psychological horror. Just horror elements are not my personal taste because it makes the film journey unsettling. Blending comedy made this a fascinating and unique experience. 

The two leads were perfectly cast here. I’d argue that this film has the best performances from both Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe. The love-hate relationship between them was so adorable. 

There probably is a lot to analyze within this film - I bet there’s lots of references to mythologies. And I think this is why some scenes and details lingered on slightly more than I’d want to.",,2024-01-06

The best part is definitely the cinematography. The camera work that sifted through the ballerina dance sequences were remarkable, I have no idea how that was filmed so perfectly. 

I also will commend Natalie Portman, definitely her best performance and she deserves all the praise for it. 

Personally, the whole time I couldn’t help but compare this to <i>Whiplash</i>, which I feel is a much better version of what this film wanted to communicate. I felt this film included too many unnecessary details (e.g. sexual subplots, an overarching horror element). While on the other hand, <i>Whiplash</i> stuck to the main story and didn’t overcomplicate through the runtime. 
But, I did see another review that described <i>Whiplash </i>as the masculine version and this film as the feminine version. I could totally follow, so I can understand if people love this film but hate <i>Whiplash</i>. 

I’m sure there’s a lot to analyze and appreciate within the themes of what the play is based on, and how it reflected into the main characters of the film. But, I just don’t care enough about exploring that. Admittedly, I’m someone that never cared about analyzing all the books we read through English classes, so this could just be a byproduct of that.

But, this film follows the same pitfalls as many Indian films I watch. Open with an interesting premise, go absolutely ludicrous and conventional directions in the end. 

The film opens with a father that has a child with cystic fibrosis. Everything about this relationship through the film is absolutely heartwarming. This setup alone was enough for me to be ready for the journey, even if it could go a predictable route. 

Frustratingly, the film decides to incorporate every over-the-top romance genre twist into the mix. We got an amnesia episode, someone needing to decide between two people to settle down with, walking away from the alter, and so much more. It’s almost like the film occasionally forgets about the cystic fibrosis element, to ensure there’s time for the typical film tropes.",,2024-01-10

I’ve grown up watching English, Hindi, and Telugu movies. I think it’s common knowledge that Hollywood movies have more international attention. Many perceive Hollywood as being “better” - I don’t fully agree, but I understand why this happens. Hollywood movies generally do a better job of showing instead of telling, and are more sharply edited. Despite this, something still appeals me to still keep watching Indian movies. This film is a good example of why I feel this way. 

This film covers a topic of how to properly handle childcare amongst working parents and grandparents. A Hollywood version of this would not have appealed to me at all. It would’ve had parents that have no close relationships to their grandparents. It would’ve had divorced parents. Overall, they would’ve included unnecessary subplots and take away from the childcare focus. 

Yes, this film shows tension amongst the parents and grandparents about how to care for the child. But, what I truly appreciated about this film is that there was never a sense of hatred. Despite the arguments, you could feel that everyone still had a familial love and respect for each other. As difficult as childcare is, no one saw it as a burden to care for the child. In this way, the film was very realistic. 

I could’ve done away with some other subplots that the film provided, and I would’ve preferred that the tension was just focused on the childcare topic. But other than that, this is a great watch.",,2024-01-13

2024-01-18,Hanu-Man,2024,https://boxd.it/5CDKwR,4.5,,"What an enjoyable  and fresh superhero journey!

I admittedly had very low expectations going into this. I was kinda put off by a superhero spin about Hanuman - the last time we saw a version of this was <i>Adipurush</i>, which was such a dumpster-fire and disrespectful to the Hindu gods. 
I was very pleasantly surprised by the fact that this actually worked! I’m thankful that there was actually faithfulness and respect to Hanuman, the Hindu god. I think this film can make people more fascinated to learn about Hanuman, which is a very good thing. 

My favorite part is that despite this being a superhero movie, it broke many of the genre conventions in the best ways. As much as I’m a bigger defender of the MCU compared to the average person, I am pretty sick of all of them doing the same thing again and again. There’s a sloppily formed villain, a third act battle with many explosions and the entire fate of the universe is very close to imploding until a certain convenience. 
This film chose to keep it contained to a small town, which paid off so well here. No reason to switch to other cities in the world, because all the heart exists in this small town. We become a part of the characters in the town, so we genuinely feel fear when they are in danger. All the nature and buildings feel so real, so we really get frustrated when destruction happens. 
The villain was also much more relatable. Sure, he had his token evil laughter moments, but his backstory was actually well developed to not feel like a token villain. 

Here is also a good example of how inflated budgets are so unnecessary. Sure, you could look at the special effects at face value and say that they are subpar at best. But, once you look at the budget, it’s actually admirable how much they did with visual effects. Many films with higher budgets are basically to the star power for some reason. 

There was a lot of fun humor around our protagonist getting his powers. It was a genuine and charming type of humor that I just don’t really see in Hollywood. 

I could nitpick this film a lot more for things like improper editing, but I don’t really see the need. The highs of this film are so high, that these details didn’t take away from my joy with the film. 

The only actual criticism I’ll have is that it included a lot of the worst tropes of Telugu masala movies. There’s inappropriate humor which is really out of place. The main actress is showcased as a model, and focuses less on the actual good she does for the community. 

This was the first time I saw a film where the word “CGI” was imprinted on the bottom left of the screen any time we saw animals. I don’t understand why this is required - the rule should just be to add a blurb at the beginning that says “no animals were harmed in the making of this film” or something. It kept taking me away out of the film. Also, the “CGI animals” were actually very realistic in most scenes - kudos to the visual effects artists.",,2024-01-17

I usually cringe at films created outside of the India/Pakistan industry but have main characters of that descent. It always holds people that hate their heritage and have the worst rebellious nature. 
But, thankful that none of that cringe existed here. It utilized the right levels of heritage references without making it an unnecessarily shoehorned part of the plot. And I believed that the characters actually act the way they do. 

My favorite part was the comedy of this film. It had the right blend of silliness and timing to all feel smart. It reminded me a lot of <i>Cobra Kai</i>, where random drama elements turn into huge fighting set pieces that are actually well crafted. 

I like that it starts out somewhat realistically in that the main character is trying to find the thorn in her sister going away for marriage, but at the surface there is nothing wrong. It seemed to perfectly capture the fear of a sibling when an older sibling goes for marriage, scared that the sibling relationship will not be the same again. 

I also appreciate the uniqueness - I don’t think I’ll ever see an Indian stuntwoman film again. And that too, especially with high school immaturity and silliness. 

Especially with the third act, plot details got way too ludicrous. Definitely did not take away from my appreciation for the film, but I wish these parts were more sharply edited.",,2024-01-13

The only thing I can really appreciate is the setting. I love the setting of a small town in Italy. Too many times we see films take place in the same cities abroad, so it was refreshing to be a part of this fresh setting. 

Other than that, nothing worked for me here. I frankly see this as “artistic” erotic romance. I don’t understand how this romance was viewed as beautiful and endearing. Personally for me, romance is endearing when it focuses on the emotional gain between the two people. I don’t relate when the romance focuses a lot on physical moments and sexual references. And I especially don’t relate when there is a strong variation in maturity between the two people.",,2024-01-20

I cannot believe this actually happened. I read up everything about this story afterwards, and I’m so shook by it. I’m so glad that this film stayed faithful to the real story in every way, keeping all the plot points and harrowing moments. It was faithful even in casting actors of the proper backgrounds and using the proper Uruguayan Spanish dialect. 

I felt breathless through the whole runtime. In a matter of seconds, the situation went from fun and games to mortal fear. The plane crash scene was absolutely scary (even when you remove the fact that this actually happened). I felt the blinding and chilling pain that the characters felt. I think this was because they set up well that the characters are literally just everyday people. Anyone can see themselves as any of the passengers of that plane. No one can be prepared for such a moment. 

What I truly appreciated was that they didn’t go a traditional film star survival route here. There wasn’t really a main character in the film. This added to the feeling that literally anyone could be the next person could die. Within a blink of the eye, even the physically and mentally strongest person can lose their life in this situation. 
In addition, there wasn’t “that one idiot character” in the mix. Everyone acted as a team player. So I could stay actually rooting for everyone. 

Even though this film follows the same plot points as the true story, I won’t spoil anything here. But, this film brings up ethical questions and I followed the same exact arc that the characters did. Pretty fascinating that the film could match my feelings as I was watching it.

I connected to every plot point that this film went through. The humble beginnings from someone in a small town to become an IPS officer. It went through all the steps in a natural manner that makes sense. 

For some reason, many Indian films portray the cops in a gross, corrupt manner. While some of that is here, the film shows the police department in a respectful manner and how the best cops will be rewarded properly. This was very refreshing. 
I also had no idea that it's this difficult to be a part of the police in India. There are so many exams and specific steps to go through, along with the ability to write thorough exams on specific topics. 

I really liked the motivation of the protagonist to become successful. One experience with a just police officer inspired him to stay faithful through the rest of his journey. This was very believable given his background. It was also cute to see his family get so excited with his successes. I rooted for him consistently through the runtime.

I weirdly have a soft spot for movies that cover a news story that I actually remember happening. The first time I remember that happening was for <i>Sully</i>, and now again for this film. 

The film showcases the funniest parts of the news story well. The fact that it was all Reddit users with their non-PC meme personas rallying everyday people to make Wall Street investors broke is such a hilarious concept. That being said, it leans a bit more into some of these than I would’ve liked. 

I can’t help feel like this would’ve been much better as a documentary though. Cool to see A-listers I guess, but the impact would’ve been better for me if I heard from the actual people getting interviewed and showing their experiences.

2024-01-28,Pain Hustlers,2023,https://boxd.it/5Hx6Zd,3.5,,"This was overall a nice time-pass film with a solid Emily Blunt performance. 

I approved of all the major plot points this goes through. I could believe that someone who is between jobs is suddenly successful in pharmaceutical sales. Obviously a plot like this will have a rise and then a fall, but the journey was investing enough. 

It is pretty jarring that things like this unfortunately occur in the pharmaceutical industry. Given how terrible its effects are on the addicted patients, a part of me wishes that the film had some more depressing images of its effects. The whole film has more of a “fun” tone like <i>The Wolf of Wall Street</i>, which makes for a fun journey, but I ultimately question if the tonal choice fits well. 

Huge respect for director David Yates for branching out of the <i>Harry Potter</i> franchise that he’s been pigeonholed into. 

I think another issue is that some parts here felt edited improperly. For example, at the beginning, Andy Garcia’s character gets crazily paranoid near the end, but it almost felt like a completely different character trait from what we saw in the beginning. Another example is that Emily Blunt’s daughter was very prominent at the beginning, and then not shown much later. Just one of these would’ve been fine, but multiple instances added up together to get an odd feeling. 

I was also not a fan of Catherine O’Hara’s inclusion. Obviously she is talented and has fun moments, but I think it deviated improperly from the best parts of the film. 

Overall, it was a fun journey and I did learn something new about how the pharmaceutical companies can get away with their behaviors. So that brings a positive recommendation from me.",,2024-01-27

And right when I’d want to do that, a new plot point emerged that seemed interesting to make me enjoy it. This continued through the runtime. I will acknowledge that this is a very unique film that took many risks so I will appreciate that. 

The film begins in a fairly heartwarming way, where a kid wants to be friends with the popular guy. I got very interested when it defied coming-of-age film tropes by immediately showing that the popular guy is actually not as douchey as you’d think. The popular guy actually had a strong heart with relatable emotions, genuinely caring about someone not as privileged as him. 

I got very concerned once they moved into the same house for the summer. I thought this would be like <i>Call Me By Your Name</i>, where it even had the same shared bathroom layout. By the end, I was thankful it didn’t go that route at all. 

This was really good at landing dark comedy. I couldn’t help but laugh when characters say the worst things at the worst times. 

Barry Keoghan was a standout performance, he truly gave it everything and should’ve deserved an Oscar nomination. 

I think it really could’ve done without the overly erotic scenes (except the very last scene, that was hilarious). I didn’t really get the point of those moments, other than make me feel uncomfortable in the worst ways. 

I was also shocked that the film did a lot of handholding to explain events, rather than leave them implied. It almost felt like the filmmakers thought the audience would be too stupid to make the necessary connections.",,2024-01-27
2024-01-31,The Last Duel,2021,https://boxd.it/5JdsLv,4.5,,"A thought-provoking drama that happens to occur during medieval times. 

The medieval setting frankly isn’t my favorite because I’m just not fascinated enough with those vibes. That being said, I still keep an open mind with it because I’ve thoroughly enjoyed some of them in the past (e.g. <i>The Northman</i>, <i>Game of Thrones</i>) as long as they add something new. And I’m glad to report that this one definitely did. 

Ridley Scott as director is enough for me to be interested - he really should be respected on the same caliber as Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg. In addition, this was the only screenplay co-written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck after <i>Good Will Hunting</i>! 

I admittedly felt like it was fairly slow paced in the first hour or so (despite appreciating the cinematography). It felt like just the typical medieval hero arc of a guy trying to get political power through marriage and gained land. 

Once the film unfolds its Rashomon effect, that’s when it gets super interesting. This storytelling device was done so effectively. Despite seeing the same scenes multiple times, seeing them from different perspectives kept it fresh. The new perspectives were both surprising and understandable given the character personalities. The least spoiler version of this is when we first see a marriage scene that appears like all happiness from the husband side. But when we see this from the wife side, it is instead fear. 
The most fascinating part for me was that we don’t just see each moment from one character’s perspective. In a way, we as the viewer are forming our neutral perspective based on what we see from the character’s perspective. So, a character could be doing an action that they believe is normal, but we know is an evil action. This makes us assign the character as evil, but also understanding that the character does not think they are evil. 
So as such new perspectives became clear, the film became much more fascinating. I retroactively appreciated the first hour a lot more (although it still felt slow). 

With medieval times comes regressive cultures that exist in the times, and we witnessed unfiltered versions of this. While normally I hate unnecessary graphic scenes, here it made sense for what the film was trying to communicate. It was a huge risk to create a medieval setting without action being the focus, but I think it overall made sense for the story. 

Despite the A-list cast, Jodie Comer was my favorite performance in the film. Her emotional diversity was executed so perfectly. Her performance in this film perfectly encapsulated why women coming forward on sexual assault allegations is a difficult choice to make. 

This film unfortunately bombed at the box office, and I think a lot of it was due to timing. It was theatrically released in 2021, when older people still were hesitant about movie theaters. If it came out any other time, I think it could’ve gotten much better buzz. 

I wish films like this get more awards attention. It’s kinda frustrating that there has to be a separate budget to push Oscar consideration because it really doesn’t level the playing field and great films that choose not to be Oscar bait then become unnoticed.",,2024-01-30

This was a realistic thriller through the disgusting world of child sex trafficking. 

What made this film very unique was that it wasn’t over-stylized or “glamorized” in the way that most thrillers are. There is no cool fight scene with the hero all bloodied up and still pushing through. The film covers the planning and tense intrigue through catching the criminals. Some can argue this causes a slow pace, but I think it was a much better choice to do it this way because it was more realistic and it showcased how scary it was to actually conduct these missions. 

I also couldn’t help but feel very emotional once the kids were rescued. Any human should get angry through what these kids faced, and feel a huge sense of relief once their pain and suffering is over. The one scene that really got to me was when the kid and his father were reunited. 

The one part I wish we got more of is the protagonist’s motivation to commit to these rescue missions. All we get is one arrest and a conversation with a friend to make him decide to sacrifice his own life to these missions. It felt very abrupt. It should’ve had more personal situations leading up to this ultimate choice. Or if the true story really was from just those moments, those moments needed to be more throughly realized. 

This part is less on the film itself and more on the political conversations around it: I don’t understand why there are controversies. I felt absolutely no political propaganda while watching this film. Stopping child sex trafficking is a unifying apolitical goal. 
I’ve also heard some controversy around the fact that some of the moments represented in the film didn’t actually occur. Even if that is true - there are countless movies based on true stories that take creative liberties to change things up. So if this type of criticism should be made to this film, it should be made to all films that take similar creative liberties.",,2024-01-31
2024-02-05,Yesterday,2019,https://boxd.it/5Lx8Gj,4.5,,"What a hidden gem of a film!

I do recall slightly hearing about this film when it came out, but I admittedly knew nothing about it other than it was somehow music related. I got curious to watch it once it came on Prime and I saw the synopsis that seemed the right amount of silly and unique. 
Thankfully, this film lived up to its premise!

There was a lot of risk that went into the execution of its premise. It could’ve focused on just fan service for The Beatles. It could’ve been a serious tone taking completely realistic plot points. It could’ve leaned in heavily into the typical teenage coming-of-age conventions. It did none of those, and took a fresh take that I honestly haven’t seen before. 

The whole premise is built upon that fact that a worldwide outage removed random things from existence from 99.99% of the population. On paper that seems so ludicrous. But here, it seemed just wacky enough to buy into it and go on board with all the associated choices. 
It also didn’t explain how the outage works, which was the right choice because it wasn’t the focus. 
Critics seemed to feel like the effects of this outage are not done realistically. Well duh, the whole concept of it is so weird! I feel like focusing on this as a negative is such a nitpick. The choices made were so funny (e.g. singing a Beatles song at a kids birthday = no appreciation) that I didn’t think the realism mattered. 

Without spoiling anything, I like that the protagonist didn’t have external forces pushing him away from his decision to capitalize on the music. Most films would’ve done this. Instead, the only forces acting against were internal guilt. I feel this film had a lot to show about consequences of actions just from internal forces. I have this feelings personally often, so it was relatable to see it get a focus on screen. 

I actually liked all the characters in the film (except Kate McKinnon’s character). That made it investing to watch. 

I was also refreshed with a minor choice in the second act. The protagonist and love interest have some scenes where they enjoy each others company and hang out through the city. It sorta signaled that the day would end with the two of them sleeping together, but they ultimately didn’t. It wasn’t shown as a rift in the relationship, but just a choice not executed upon. I wish more films could do this. 

Three things I’d say against the movie:
1) A choice made by the love interest in the second suddenly came out of left field, and I wish it could’ve been explored further before making that choice. 
2) Kate McKinnon’s character was basically playing as the actor’s personality and not as a character in the film. This really took me out of the movie because it didn’t gel with the rest of the tone. 
3) A final third act that was really blown out of proportion. Many movies tend to do this for some weird reason, and I wish this one didn’t.",,2024-02-04

It’s very easy to compare this unfavorably the <i>Top Gun </i>franchise, but I will not because it really is an unfair comparison. Those movies are essentially perfect, and there aren’t other major aviator military films out there. Regardless, this film has a lot to commend. 

There was a lot of great India nationalism vibes here (a.k.a “f*** yeah India”) which was infectious. That made me really want to root for our protagonists through the whole film. 

The film is very well paced too. It has a hefty runtime, but it didn’t feel that way because there was always something engrossing going on. 

I was also happy to see that the romance in the film did not feel forced. Forced romance is really common for action thrillers like this. But here, Deepika Padukone’s character brought forth many important parts to the story. 

It was also refreshing to see Hrithik Roshan again on the big screen. This guy just naturally oozes charisma. He makes everyday song and dance numbers feel so much more hype. In a film where dance numbers should feel out of place, here I couldn’t stop watching the dance numbers because he dances so well. The jokes around his charisma are definitely meta fan service, but also…he has charisma so it works. 

I could nitpick the flaws present here. Yes, there’s a lot of telling and not showing. Yes, there are many conveniences. Yes, the over-the-top ludicrous action scenes don’t mesh well with the realistic themes that the film brings up. But, the high moments are so high that I didn’t care.

Most movies nowadays will portray the future with a clean CGI feel. But movies back in the day will meticulously craft each detail and still keep a “dirty” setting to feel lived-in. 

My favorite parts of this film are the parts that feel the most realistic. This film shows an important issue with privatizing police work, which is thought-provoking. The POV perspectives from RoboCop (especially when he is first turned on) has the right type of realistic and creepy dark comedy. The emotions when RoboCop’s face is shown for the first time is unsettling in the right ways. 

Huge respect for the actor of RoboCop that was able to act so well with just the mouth getting screen time for most of it. 

The over-the-top action scenes really didn’t work for me. I was fully onboard with gore, but I was taken out of the film anytime unrealistic action scenes occurred. I think this choice was done to “fit in” with 80s action flicks, but the premise really didn’t need this.",,2024-02-10
2024-02-11,Animal,2023,https://boxd.it/5O9OvL,0.5,,"This is without a doubt one of the worst films I’ve seen. 

The best way to talk about this film is to compare it to <i>Scarface</i>. <i>Scarface </i>has a protagonist that has disgusting behaviors and commits evil acts to move up the criminal food chain. It also has over-the-top action and gore. 
The difference is that despite all these negativities, you as the viewer can’t help but want to see the protagonist in <i>Scarface </i>continue the evil acts and destroy everyone in his path. This is because he is very calculated in his actions, and in a way deserves his successes along the way. 
On the other hand, this film does not have a compelling protagonist. In fact, he is unlikeable in every way. He is unhinged in an upsetting way, and not in a fearful way. Any normal person would clearly diagnose this person with a mental health problem, or be worthy of the death penalty with the crimes he commits. Yet, the film keeps pushing us root for this character (and even sympathize for him). The film and I were completely misaligned on this front. 

I also couldn’t appreciate the over-the-top action scenes. They weren’t silly enough to laugh along, or smart enough to appreciate the art. I just wanted the action scenes to be over. 

I have no idea how this film got so much box office love. Initially I felt proud that an Indian film was literally the number 1 film in the worldwide box office for a weekend. Now, I feel embarrassed that this film got such a distinction.",,2024-02-10
2024-02-17,Maestro,2023,https://boxd.it/5Qxt7J,2,,"I wanted to like this movie because of how talented Bradley Cooper is. I am definitely still intrigued to see what more he can offer to film, but unfortunately I think this film really missed the mark. 

I admittedly knew nothing about Leonard Bernstein prior to this film. Hearing the music he conducted through the film really made me appreciate his talent, I didn’t realize how prolific his music has been in the film industry. This excited me to learn about his creative planning. How does the brain of such a talented individual operate to generate the music we have the privilege of experiencing?
However, the film doesn’t explore that. It felt more like a biography, with the composer bits as background filler. 
I also just couldn’t buy into why this character succumbed to all his vices. It began with a very charming romantic relationship with his wife, and then he had a bunch of affairs. I get that these were the real events that occurred, but there wasn’t enough to explain why he did that. Other biopics show how fame turns people into worse versions of themselves, but there wasn’t enough here to show why he made all those choices. 

I guess there were good performances from Bradley Cooper and Carey Mulligan. But overall, there isn’t enough memorable here for me. More focus on the music would’ve made me feel more positive.",,2024-02-16
2024-02-17,Okja,2017,https://boxd.it/5QOPnX,3.5,,"This has been in my Netflix watchlist for quite some time. The past Bong Joon-Ho films I watched were <i>Snowpiercer</i> and <i>Parasite</i>, both of which I loved way more than I expected to. I knew I had to watch this soon because it’s been on Netflix for a long time and I was afraid of it getting pulled off Netflix (still upset I didn’t get the chance to see <i>Hush</i> before it got pulled off). 

This film is definitely enjoyable. Lots of funny moments and many thrilling scenes. The chase sequences here are very top-notch, to the Spielberg level of quality. I have to give major points for a unique premise. And still huge respect to Bong Joon-Ho as a director. The main child actor of Ahn Seo-hyun was strong, and showcased a lot of admirable physical abilities for the role. The relationship between Mija and Okja was charming. 

My problem with the film though, is that details felt very inconsistently executed. For example, the characters in the Animal Liberation Front strongly show that they will never harm animals or humans. But, there are moments when they do so when it’s convenient for the plot. The character of Jake Gyllenhaal came off very annoying to me and out-of-place with the greater themes of the film. 

Still, this is a good watch for all audiences. I think this is a pretty good first film to watch into the Bong Joon-Ho filmography.",,2024-02-16
2024-02-18,Bottoms,2023,https://boxd.it/5Rii2d,3.5,,"With such a premise, I expected to roll my eyes and get frustrated with too much raunchiness and misguided directions. This ended up being solid laugh-out-loud silliness with a crowd. I definitely recommend watching this with an audience. 

I’m glad that this didn’t go over-the-top with preachiness, as many films nowadays do. This was a high school silly comedy that happens to have high school girls attracted to other girls. That’s the right way to keep the audience invested. Jokes felt like they were crafted with proper comedic timing, and not as an assembly line of directives from executives. 

I surprisingly really related to the main characters. Sure, they would say ridiculously stupid things, but what high school kid doesn’t? 

Marshawn Lynch as the advisor to the club was perfect in every way possible. 

As for flaws, some parts went a little too ludicrous for me. Also, there were definite inconsistencies. Obviously this isn’t a major negative for high school raunchy comedies, but it was enough to notice. 

Years from now, I could definitely see this turning into cult status like <i>Mean Girls</i>.",,2024-02-17

The film went straight into thrills and it kept those thrills all the way until the end. 

I was very surprised with how thought-provoking this film turned into. It wasn’t a run-of-the-mill average plot. There was a fascinating play with time travel that was emotionally effective. The protagonist was not just perfect from the start, and had required character growth to explore. The side characters were also very charming and relatable. I was afraid that they would be useless comic relief, but they had actual important impact to the plot. 

The setting isn’t “flashy” with bright colors, which I think was the right move because it felt more realistic. Although, this probably hurt its box office performance as kids and parents probably thought this would be boring. 

Without spoiling anything, the ultimate villain was actually perfect for our protagonist and didn’t feel as cliched as I thought it would at first glance. 

My only flaw was that it could’ve gone less in the exposition (or at least convey the same exposition in a cleaner manner).",,2024-02-25
2024-02-27,Mystic River,2003,https://boxd.it/5VBmO5,3,,"Personally I got into film a lot more from 2015 onwards - that’s when I started paying attention to specific actors and directors, and what gets the Oscar buzz. So I’m always surprised to learn about films that exist in the recent past that definitely would’ve gotten my attention if I was my current age in that year. Here is one of those films - a Clint Eastwood directed film that one two Actor awards in the year when <i>Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King</i> swept everything. 

I was super invested in this film at the very beginning. The opening scene with the kids was unsettling in the right ways. Then a jump to their adult selves - I couldn’t wait to explore how the opening scene affected all of them. 

What unfolded was a mystery that was definitely interesting and what makes me ultimately give this a positive review. It’s a solid mystery where we are given the right pieces of information at the right times, and feel the right doubts towards the right people as needed. 

The ending unfortunately really tanked this movie for me. Without spoiling anything, it felt like the wrong characters were punished for the actions and the right characters were not punished for their actions. It almost felt like giant character shifts happened in the end out of the blue. 

Apparently Sean Penn won an award here over Johnny Depp’s Jack Sparrow. I strongly disagree with this. Sean Penn was good I guess, but it was a performance I’ve seen before. Jack Sparrow was most definitely lightning in a bottle that should’ve been praised more than it did.",,2024-02-26
2024-02-29,The New Mutants,2020,https://boxd.it/5Wp0DJ,4,,"While most people state that the MCU has cracked the ideal formula for a shared superhero universe (ignoring the quantity over quality in their recent projects), personally I’ve always appreciated the X-Men series a lot more. Sure, there’s been a wide range of quality in this series, but the great part about it is that there are many unique genres and aspects to it. We saw true grit with <i>The Wolverine </i>and <i>Logan</i>, we saw raunchy comedy gold with the <i>Deadpool </i>films, and we saw smart usage of time travel in <i>Days of Future Past</i>. And most underrated - we saw effective team up films with multiple superheroes without feeling exposition heavy. 
The film adds to my appreciation of the X-Men series. It truly felt more like a horror film than what was attempted in <i>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</i>. It had believable and effective enough use of coming-of-age themes. It’s a contained film that sits well by itself, and is a believable addition to a superhero universe without feeling like a shameless set-up to other films. I wish franchises could branch out into other genres rather than sticking to the same formula - this is how franchises can branch out their audience appeal. 

I was onboard with all the major choices in this film. The idea of five flawed teenage mutants (I almost ended that with “ninja turtles” lol) in a confined space is fascinating. They are experiencing unusual life struggles during puberty stages - anyone would sympathize while watching this. 

The contained nature was very refreshing - it genuinely didn’t feel like a superhero film to me. There wasn’t a bloated third act where the entire world would end unless *** happens. The ramifications were small scale but also investing to the characters. 

I’m pretty upset that the story around this film was all around its delayed release time and potential reshoots and that it’s from a now defunct franchise. There is a lot of merit in this film and it easily could’ve found a following amongst non-superhero fans too. 

I do have some flaws. 
I rarely say this, but it could’ve used more runtime to delve deeper into the backgrounds of the quirky characters. Understanding why they are how they are could’ve helped with relating to them better. 
I was happy with the mix of horror with coming-of-age, but it could’ve gelled together more cleanly. It almost felt like I’d see different movies for each scene, when more effective editing would’ve combined them together properly. 

I wouldn’t urge everyone to watch this, as it’s not perfect. But I hope directions like this can be take for more franchise bloat we will inevitably see from Hollywood.",,2024-02-28
2024-03-01,Dune: Part Two,2024,https://boxd.it/5WOw1R,4.5,,"In my <i>Dune </i>review, I gave myself an order to watch this film in IMAX. I actually held up to that, and I’m so glad I did. This is the first film in a while that I felt really needed the theater experience. In addition, I normally don’t think IMAX is worth it, but here it was definitely warranted. The IMAX aspect ratio persisted through the whole film, truly elevating the scope of the visuals in this world.  The full budget of the film exists on the screen, and doesn't feel like they just funded high actor salaries.

Denis Villeneuve is truly one of the greatest directors working today. He is able to effectively combine style with substance. Amongst all the films with an overabundance of CGI, the visuals in his film are masterfully crafted and stand out as beautiful spectacle. 
This film has really weird moments like grasping water from corpses, a sentient fetus, and people riding sandstorms. A normal production would feel campy and stupid with all these elements. But, this film is able to incorporate these with a serious tone that is believable for the world crafted in front of our eyes. This is only possible from a truly talented director like Denis Villeneuve. 
His signature direction is to take it slow to immerse you in the world he creates. While I do definitely appreciate this, it has a mixed effect on my love for his films. I loved it for <i>Arrival</i>, <i>Prisoners</i>, and <i>Dune</i>. I admittedly didn’t love it in his other films. I think this film was a slightly slower pace than my liking. 

I think the best way to praise this film is to compare it with <i>John Carter</i> (which barely anyone saw or knows about). Both source materials influenced a lot of the sci-fi we know today. Both have been referred to as unadaptable to the film screen because it would ironically seem derivative to other sci-fi films that the mainstream audiences praise. Both had giant budgets with really weird world rules. <i>John Carter </i>absolutely tanked, while this one excels. 

Each character is perfectly cast and acted. Each character has fascinating unique traits that make them believably a part of the world. Javier Bardem’s character generated a lot of great laughs for me (and his trait wasn't just comic relief but there was actual impact and reasoning behind this trait existing). Austin Butler went through a huge transformation from Elvis to one of the creepiest things I’ve ever seen. 
Through the runtime, I was really questioning the casting choice of Timothée Chalamet. I didn’t really question it in <i>Dune</i> because he didn’t actually have too much focus time as a typical protagonist would. But in this film, he is much more of a central focus. Ultimately I think his casting choice made sense based on the plot developments near the end of the film. My interpretation is that this character is meant to have imperfections, and this performance made those plot choices believable. 

Speaking of the plot, I was actually pretty surprised with the ending. I thought there would be huge scale third-act battles. The war battle scenes are breathtaking, but the characters took further focus. The characters had no easy decisions to make, and they all had the expected ramifications. Overall it didn’t take any easy crowd-pleasing directions, but went much more thought-provoking routes. 

My main flaw is that I think I needed more explanation for some of the lore in the film. I was surprised at how well I grasped all the required information in <i>Dune </i>without having any prior knowledge of the world. But here, a lot more lore was important to the plot and I didn’t grasp every detail. I’m sure a rewatch with subtitles would solve the gaps for me, but for now this is how I feel. 

In the future I will have to watch both films back-to-back as a marathon. I watched YouTube videos with a recap of the first film before watching this one, but there minor details from the first film that were significant callbacks in the second film. I will appreciate this more upon rewatch.

I’m pretty surprised that audiences are reacting so positively to this film. It’s not an everyday blockbuster in that you can find enjoyment just in the visuals; it is paced slower than average, and you are required to listen closely to every word of dialogue to truly appreciate. In contrast, personally I think the <i>Star Wars</i> and <i>Lord of the Rings</i> films could get huge mass appeal because their fun visuals and fast paced nature could be attractive to all ages and backgrounds, even if their lores aren’t perfectly understood. Maybe this is an indication that audiences will appreciate high brow entertainment more than I give them credit for. That is an overall good thing, so no complaints from me.",,2024-02-29
2024-03-02,Dunki,2023,https://boxd.it/5XdIej,3.5,,"A solid time pass with a unique premise!

I was pretty hype about a collaboration between Shah Rukh Khan and Rajkumar Hirani. All of Hirani’s films have been classics. I love his comedic timing. However, I was personally mixed on <i>Sanju</i> - I felt the purpose had a lot of inconsistencies and the comedy didn’t really mesh well. 
I was more positive with this film, but I have similar issues as with <i>Sanju</i>. 

First, the premise. I think the main idea came across very well. The image of life in another country may appear all shiny and beautiful, but it’s not as simple as that. I think this film did a great showcase of the complexities with immigration. Not every person <i>needs </i>to come into a country for safety - many times they have problems that won’t be solved by coming into another country. In that regard, I think this is a must-see for anyone that is thinking about immigrating. At the same time, we can relate to the suffering that people go through when they immigrate. 

There were a good number of touching moments too. In particular, a court scene with Shah Rukh Khan had the right messaging (even if it wasn’t directed perfectly). 

I’ll also give some props to Shah Rukh Khan for actually being believable as a ~30 year old. Maybe it was a lot of really believable makeup?

My main issue is the choice of incorporating Rajkumar Hirani’s comedic style into this premise. I don’t think they meshed well together. This would’ve been a much better film if it kept a serious tone about the immigration topic without incorporating slapstick comedy.",,2024-03-01
2024-03-10,Dawn of the Dead,2004,https://boxd.it/613qPx,4.5,,"I am actually very shocked with how much I enjoyed this movie. It may be low brow zombie action without a greater purpose, but it executes it so well that I didn’t care!

I first heard about this movie in fourth grade when, for whatever reason, the entire class really wanted our teacher to play the movie for us. With the R-rating, that obviously was never going to happen. I joined the class and also championed for it, but that was solely because everyone else was doing it. Internally, nothing about zombies appealed to me at the time. 

I decided to watch this because it was leaving Netflix soon. Also, I’m always most interested in seeing early films of well-known directors. Interestingly, some of my favorite films from directors are their early films when they utilized their limited budget to the fullest potential (e.g. Quentin Tarantino’s <i>Reservoir Dogs</i>, Christopher Nolan’s <i>Memento</i>). Now, I have another example to add - Zack Snyder. 

I expected mindless action, but I didn’t actually get that. That’s probably my favorite part of the film. All the action stayed consistent with the rules it presented, so despite a ludicrous zombie premise I could believe that this plot could actually exist in real life. Plans were clearly discussed and then executed, so you could understand why people made certain decisions. For example, a chainsaw plan was shown off before we actually see zombies killed by the chainsaw. Most movies would’ve just shown the raw chainsaw killings for the cool visuals, but Zack Snyder smartly decided to include setup to keep believability. 
Characters actually have scenes of experiencing emotional trauma, so they don’t feel like lifeless creatures. We start the film with the protagonist losing her whole family. Later on, she runs away and is finally safe. As the adrenaline died down, we see a scene of her crying. Little moments like this are valuable to keep character consistency, and not feel like the film is only cutting back to characters when convenient for the plot. 

I really liked the aspect where a greater number of zombies exist in the outside world as time goes on. This was the proper use of increasing escalating stakes as the film goes on, adding to the tension. 

My one flaw was with everything around the pregnant character. That was the one moment where I felt characters acted very illogically and inconsistent with the rest of the film. 

I was pleasantly surprised with the cast of this film, many cast members that were before projects I associate them with. All of them played different characters than what I was used to, and it was pleasant to see that range. 
The protagonist of the film is acted by Sarah Polley, who would later direct <i>Women Talking</i>. Good for her!

I didn’t know that this movie was technically a remake until I subsequently read a couple reviews. Many of these reviews seemed to criticize the movie for not being a “proper” adaptation because it removes the social commentary and focuses on raw zombie violence. Obviously I didn’t watch the original movie, but I don’t think I would share these thoughts. I would criticize in this way if it was an assembly line-produced film that just feels like everything else we’ve seen. But, this is a zombie film that was still meticulously crafted, even if it was focused on the raw action aspects. Not everything needs valuable social commentary, as long as a solid journey is crafted.",,2024-03-09
2024-03-11,Being the Ricardos,2021,https://boxd.it/61JYJ3,4,,"Aaron Sorkin is an absolute magician with screenplays, and that alone will always make me interested to see all of his work. <i>The Social Network </i>and <i>Molly’s Game</i> are must-sees in my opinion due to his masterful screenplay. And this film also has that Aaron Sorkin signature grip. 

This film has been on my watchlist for a while due to Aaron Sorkin’s involvement. I do recall watching some <i>I Love Lucy </i>episodes had many laugh out loud moments, so I was curious to see Sorkin’s take here. 

From the first line, I was immediately pulled in. The Sorkin dialogue feels like its own character of the film that engrosses you into even the most boring subjects. It just snaps so fast, yet at the same time you’re somehow able to keep track of everything. The film is able to mesh many subplots together without feeling like a lot to keep track of. This dialogue made me so invested into whatever this film was producing. It made even something as minor as table reads super thrilling. Whatever Aaron Sorkin has is an absolute superpower. 
This dialogue was a great use of showcasing a unique part of the television creative production process that I found fascinating. As table reads and practices went through, the scripts of the episodes were scrutinized. Does it make sense for Lucy to make a certain action and say a certain line? Details like this matter to stay consistent with the character and keep the audience invested to watch the next episode. Being so detail-oriented was probably the reason that <i>I Love Lucy </i>was so successful. 

My next favorite part of this film is definitely Nicole Kidman as Lucille Ball. I genuinely did not ever see Nicole Kidman’s face in this performance, because it truly felt like I was watching Lucille Ball. Her performance was also the sole reason that made me really want to research more about her backstory. 

My criticism was around the second half of the film. It kinda felt like it lost the charisma that the first half had. I somehow became less interested and excited with how the plot was going to progress. This may be because the dialogue was not as gripping or the uniqueness lost its charm. Nothing was bad per se, but it felt like a drop in quality.",,2024-03-10
2024-03-15,Poor Things,2023,https://boxd.it/63qjf7,2.5,,"When I watch Oscar movies, it is common for me to think “I didn’t hate it, but it felt so overhyped and undeserving of all those nominations”. For this film, I have a unique feeling. It deserved all the Oscar wins (Emma Stone for Best Actress, Best Production Design, Best Costume Design, Best Makeup and Hairstyling) but it’s really difficult for me to recommend anything else about it. 

First with the positives. Yes, Emma Stone definitely deserved Best Actress. Acting as such a child with a messed up mental growth is not at all easy, and she performed it amazingly. I was in awe of everything she did. 
Very unique feel. The Victorian London setting is usually very boring for me, but here it was combined with an oddly tinkered alternate universe and suddenly made it fascinating. I’d love to see another film with a completely different plot and characters in this setting. 
The fisheye lens and off-putting score were perfect juxtaposition with the idea of this film. Given that the concept of creating a Frankenstein-like creature is so ethically wrong, having these off-putting editing choices adds to it. These were also done in a proper enough extent where I wasn’t put off by the film itself. 

My main issue is with the choice of going such a sexualized direction with the plot. That immediately just made me not interested in the plot. I don’t know why many films choose this direction, and why it gets praised in awards regardless of the promiscuous themes. After logging this film in my Letterboxd, I noticed that most of my watched films of the year fell in the theme “erotic relationships and desire” which is weird because it’s the type of films I try to avoid. Looking at what encompassed this list, it was <i>Saltburn</i>, <i>Call Me By Your Name</i>, <i>May December</i>, <i>Black Swan</i>, and this film. Everything mentioned here are all Oscar buzz films. I think that definitely says something about the films that get awards attention (and therefore, why films keep exploring these themes). 
I would normally just move on, but I feel a lot of shame from this film in particular. A film that is not rated R, didn’t explore erotic themes, and kept this type of setting would’ve had huge appreciation from everyday audiences. It definitely would’ve gotten great word-of-mouth from everyone to experience it on the big screen. But because of its erotic themes, none of that will ever be experienced by most audiences. 

I am interested enough with pieces of this film to check out more of the filmography or Yorgos Lanthimos. But, I can’t recommend this film. 

Sidebar - I saw a comment that mentioned Mark Ruffalo’s character looks like Lalo Salamanca, and I seriously can’t unsee that!",,2024-03-14
2024-03-20,Article 370,2024,https://boxd.it/65N2FV,4,,"Seems like here’s another situation where critics rate this as very good or very bad, depending on their political leanings. I wish people could critique just the filmmaking of movies as separate from political themes. 
On the other hand, I understand that it’s very difficult to portray relatively recent events in film without appearing subjective. History does need some time to fester to actually understand its ramifications. And that’s much harder for people to grasp in a world that has so much fast-paced social media atmosphere. 

Now, to the actual film…

Admittedly, I don’t have as much awareness of the politics with Kashmir. While this film explained aspects well enough, a stronger awareness of the Kashmir history definitely would’ve helped here. But, this film did make me subsequently research about it so I do feel it is ultimately a good thing that it made me learn something to further my general knowledge. 

As far as the actual filmmaking, this is definitely competently made. A good mix of political thrills with action. I’m sure the actual events were not as cinematic as what the film shows, but to be honest every film about actual events is dramatized. 

My flaw is that parts did feel boring and dialogue did drag. Again, if I was more closely involved with Kashmir politics, I’d probably relate to it more and not feel as bored. 

Definitely a good watch. It will make you think about Kashmir politics in different ways, which is a good thing regardless of your personal political leaning. I never really felt like it was pushing propaganda.",,2024-03-19
2024-03-21,The Marvels,2023,https://boxd.it/66h0L3,2,,"Not the worst of the MCU, but very messy. 

I admittedly had really low expectations going into this movie. The characterization of Captain Marvel has been subpar through the MCU, and I had low hopes of this getting better with this film. This was also a film that seemed to require a lot of homework across many tv shows. 

The best praise I can give is that this movie didn’t make me angry like the worst of the MCU (e.g. <i>Ant-Man 3</i>, <i>She-Hulk</i>). The worst of the MCU are ones that just shouldn’t have existed in the first place. Here, I could actually see a good MCU addition with this idea. The problem was that it was executed as obligatory MCU content without having much purpose. 

I agree with most criticisms that the screenplay was not crisp enough. Obviously no one expects perfection, but we expect at least something competent enough to follow along. Most plot points were explained away with quick science mumbo jumbo, without any setup/payoff. 

There were fun moments that definitely warranted good laughs, but they just don’t mesh well with the rest of the film. For example, Ms. Marvel’s family were a part of fight scenes - this is funny, but it’s unbelievable for a family like that to fight alien soldiers. Superheroes begging for help on a planet feels like low stakes when everyone on the planet sings. I’m not against these choices in a film, but they don’t work juxtaposed with everything else. 

There were parts of this that felt like a great and unique addition to the franchise. The best parts were when the three leads were just being girls together (e.g. everyone comforting each other, practicing alignment with body switching). If this was explored more, I predict the film would’ve been a lot more praised and been a lot more positive with the box office. 

I agree that Iman Vellani’s Ms. Marvel was the best part of this film, but I’d rather recommend watching her own show than this film.

A side praise is that you didn’t actually need to see other properties in the franchise to fully appreciate this film. 

I feel the most bad for Brie Larson. She was great in <i>Room </i>and undoubtedly has great acting talent. The MCU just isn’t exploring her talent well enough, and I’m worried that the MCU is preventing her from getting valuable other projects to grow through.",,2024-03-20
2024-03-23,Anatomy of a Fall,2023,https://boxd.it/674mNN,4.5,,"Many days after watching this film, I’m still thinking hard about all the scenes I’ve watched. 

I went into this film expecting a mystery type of movie on how a murder occurred. What I did not expect was the thought-provoking social commentary. I somehow ended the film caring less about the murder mystery aspect (which was still fascinating) and more about the themes of truths to each individual. I found myself making many comparisons to real-life highly publicized court cases. 
This is my favorite type of social commentary from films. Many films (e.g. <i>Don’t Look Up</i>) are so direct on forcing you to learn its messages and agree with them, and I think as a result they become less effective. On the other hand, smarter films like this will lay out the premise and leave the interpretation to the viewer. 

As a viewer, I was gripped into the courtroom scenes because I also felt like I was trying to solve the mystery. As I heard a recording of a verbal argument between a husband and wife, I too was asking “Is there any evidence of motive within this conversation, or is it totally unrelated?” 

The film was properly edited in every regard. Details around the murder and family members were revealed at the right parts of the film to keep me invested. Cuts between us actually seeing the verbal argument, and the courtroom’s reactions to the transcript were executed perfectly. The mix of spoken languages was unique to see in a film, yet also realistic since many people are exposed to multiple languages in day-to-day life. 

Here are one of the few examples where I believe a film actually deserved its Oscar attention. My only addition is that the child performance was stellar - I haven’t seen enough reviews mention this. 

My one criticism is that I felt the film’s runtime. It could’ve been about 30 minutes shorter. 

It is a movie focused on dialogue. Don’t let that deter you from watching it, but don’t watch it when you’re getting tired.",,2024-03-22
2024-03-24,Notting Hill,1999,https://boxd.it/67gQsT,3,,"Classic rom-com with great fun and charm!

I’m always down for a charming rom-com, it’s a great mood-booster. I was intrigued by this film because it’s one of many that launched Julia Roberts into a household name for rom-coms. 

My favorite part is that this feels like a time capsule to simpler times. Things aren’t overly flashy and sexualized. Despite Julia Roberts actually having an actress role in the movie, she came off as less “fake” than what I see in modern rom-coms. This probably has a lot to do with social media. 
In addition, despite this film being known more for Julia Roberts than Hugh Grant, we don’t really see much about the background of her character. While normally this would feel odd, here it worked because it added to the “mysteriousness” of an actress meshing in normal world. 

Another thing I really appreciated is that the comedic lines were written in a much more natural manner. We still had eccentric characters, but the jokes still felt like they fit in, rather than stopping the whole rhythm of the scene for a punchline. 

There was a point near the end of the film where I was shocked it was gonna go in an unconventional direction, but I was a bit disappointed that it ended in the normal. This isn’t necessarily bad, just something I noticed. 

Overall this is a fun time pass if you want a rom-com mood booster. I could understand it being a hit at the time of release, but I don’t see a major reason to seek this one out.",,2024-03-23
2024-03-27,Wonka,2023,https://boxd.it/691jEl,4.5,,"It’s impossible to watch this film without smiling :D

Like everyone else, I also had low expectations for some reason going into this. I wasn’t convinced with Timothee Chalamet being a proper Willy Wonka, an origin story of Willy Wonka felt like a cash grab, and the trailers didn’t really pull me in. 
Also like everyone else, I was very charmed and don’t know why I went in with low expectations. I’m admittedly not in love with <i>Paddington</i> and <i>Paddington 2</i> but I agree that those are very cute movies and I wish more family-friendly films could match that charm. Paul King definitely brings that classic charm to this film too. From the second I saw the opening credits mention “A Paul King confection”, I knew I’d be watching a film that is truly embracing its charm. 

This is the type of movie that I wish could be made more often. I’m the biggest defender of everyday animated films because they are entertaining and visually beautiful, but I do understand that adults can feel bored by the conventional ones. This type of film is what would be appreciated even by such adults. There’s lots of silly humor that is clean for kids and also fun for adults. 

What surprised me the most is that despite being a prequel to a known IP, it really feels unique. The setting feels like its own character with a lot to explore. Willy Wonka’s whim was super fun in a lead role of a film. It had a lot of silliness without losing credibility. No distracting romantic subplot with the main character. 

I was initially very skeptical with Timothee Chalamet as the choice. I didn’t really feel much charm from the trailers for some reason. The film itself shows him with lots of positivity and whim that is infectious to the viewers. He may not match the depictions of prior film adaptations, but that doesn’t matter because he brings his own fun personality into it. 
With this film and <i>Dune: Part Two</i>, I will now officially stop doubting Timothee Chalamet. 

It was released at the perfect time in theaters. This is a perfect Christmas time movie theater trip. Kids and adults all will walk away with joy. I could definitely imagine this becoming a cult classic for kids growing up around the release of this movie. 

Making it as a musical was actually a great choice. I don’t really imagine the songs becoming memorable through the years, but they are fun musical numbers to watch and fit in well with the plot. 

The only thing that stops me from a perfect score is the love story subplot with Olivia Coleman’s character. That was too weird for me, and I didn’t enjoy how many times the film cuts back to this. 

Another weird nitpick I have is that I didn’t really walk away from this film with a craving for chocolate. Not that a film like this was required to do so, but I definitely walked away from the other film adaptations with a chocolate craving. 

Overall, this is a great mood-boosting watch for all types of audiences.",,2024-03-26
2024-03-28,House of Gucci,2021,https://boxd.it/69teoj,2,,"Well filmed, but also unfortunately forgettable. 

Ridley Scott as director is enough for me to watch a film. Admittedly, that was the only draw for me. 

Credit where credit is due - great performances across the board. 
Lady Gaga in particular was stellar. I wouldn’t call her Oscar worthy, but she stood out amongst other huge and refined actors like Al Pacino. 
Jared Leto actually didn’t annoy me as much as other reviews state. I honestly could not see his face under those prosthetics - reminded me of Colin Farrell in <i>The Batman</i>. 

Once the film shows what it’s truly about, it gets a lot more interesting. The yearn for power was intriguing, but not to levels comparable to <i>Game of Thrones </i>or <i>Breaking Bad</i>. You can’t help but respect how well Patrizia Reggiani operates (even if she’s a criminal). 

The most interesting portions to me were when it was focused on how to improve the Gucci brand (e.g. Lady Gaga’s character seeking out the off-brand products). 

The main drawback for me was that it overall felt derivative of other historical business stories. More emphasis on the Gucci empire and products would’ve interested me. 

Also, the film is definitely 30 minutes longer than it needed to be. 

The only reason I’d recommend watching is to complete Ridley Scott’s filmography (or if you love the Gucci story).",,2024-03-27
2024-03-31,Creed III,2023,https://boxd.it/6aZiol,4,,"Another thrilling boxing story in a consistent franchise. I’ve given every film in this franchise a positive review, and it continues with this film. 

There was apparently a lot of behind-the-scenes drama with Sylvester Stallone not being involved in this film. I don’t have enough backstory to comment on the business dealings there. But what I can say is I didn’t think this film felt “incomplete” with the exclusion of Rocky’s character. Rocky had a pretty good sendoff in <i>Creed II</i>, so I think the franchise is set up fine to only focus on Adonis Creed going forward. 

This film included anime-style editing through its boxing scenes. This actually worked for me very well. Most live-action anime adaptations fail because they can’t keep the same tone that was possible with the anime. But here, I felt it was well done. I felt like I could vision the thought process that the boxers went through right before they made their punches. 
The downside of this editing choice is that it doesn’t feel as much like real fighting occurring on screen. My personal favorites of the franchise are the fights that feel the most real. That being said, I welcome changes that are done well like this. 

Totally loved the performances of Michael B. Jordan and Jonathan Majors. Damian was a great foil to Adonis and I was fully bought into this storyline. I definitely felt this “villain” character is amongst the best realized of the franchise because it had moments of affecting not just Adonis but others in his family. A particular conversation between Damian and Bianca about fame was very intriguing for me. 

The whole film was well paced, which kept it from being boring. 

The main flaw I had with this film was the editing of the storylines. Plot points ended in odd ways. In particular, a plot point about Amara (Adonis and Bianca’s daughter) initially developed in an interesting manner because the parents had very opposite ways to address it and I was curious to see how it would resolve. But, this plot point ended up not being really resolved. 

Slight nitpick - this film plot depends on Adonis and Damian being “old” and “past their primes”. This was pretty hard to believe, considering how ripped their bodies clearly are through the film. In contrast, Sylvester Stallone was 60 years old when <i>Rocky Balboa</i> released and it was much easier to buy into an aging athlete there. It would’ve made much better sense to choose a story with these characters that fit their ages. In addition, with a story like this, I’m skeptical on what could be believable stories in sequels.",,2024-03-30
2024-04-03,Blue Beetle,2023,https://boxd.it/6cqDPF,2,,"The most “Superhero: The Movie” superhero movie I’ve seen. 

I had fairly high hopes going into this. Of the 4 DCEU movies released in 2023, this one seemed to have the best reviews. And I personally felt positive about <i>Shazam: Fury of the Gods </i>and <i>The Flash</i>, so I thought I’d be positive about this one too. 
In addition, I absolutely loved Xolo Maridueña in <i>Cobra Kai</i> and thought he’d be a fantastic choice for a young superhero. I was also looking forward to seeing George Lopez again for the first time in a while. 

Unfortunately, everything about this movie reeked of clichés. A random person suddenly gets superpowers and has a scene of struggling to utilize the superpowers. Then, we just believe that he suddenly has full control of his powers, which leads to a CGI fest of fight scenes. A shoehorned romantic subplot. A one-note corporate villain focused just on evil, complete with a whole mansion on an island. 

What seemed so odd to me was this film had all the pieces to be much more. 
There are glimpses of an urban city where skyscrapers had holograms, juxtaposed with the area our lead family lives that is struggling to pay rent for a puny house. I thought this would have a unique perspective to the overdone theme of rich getting richer and poor getting poorer. But, these hologram buildings are literally just showpieces in the background. Our corporate villain’s building doesn’t even have the hologram aesthetic that the neighboring buildings have, which is odd especially when this corporation is touted as hugely corrupt and rich. 
What I found refreshing about these characters was that it was a young adult with superpowers that wasn’t hiding his powers from his family. Many times we don’t see relatives involved with the superhero (and this was a family with investing characterization) so I was excited to see their involvement. But, we don’t get enough time to flesh this out. The formulaic plot requirements of getting characters into certain places at certain times really hindered the potential here. 
George Lopez didn’t really work for me here either. It seems his characterization was basically giving plot armor to our heros, and I didn’t think his comedic lines were that good. 
Xolo as Jaime Reyes/Blue Beetle was great casting, and this could’ve flourished a lot more if the movie was better for him. 
A characterization mentioned is that Jaime Reyes is completely against murder (even to villains). This was set up for one interesting plot point in the end, but other than that this was basically forgotten by the film. His relatives literally killed many people. Jaime was in scenes where others died and he could’ve saved them if he truly cared about this mindset. 
Grandma with a Gatling gun is definitely a fun watch, and I would’ve been much more on board if the film set this up better. 

The worst for me were the plot conveniences that we’re somehow supposed to ignore. In a world where the villain has an unlimited supply of technology and army men, it’s hard to believe that an everyday family is able to escape their wrath. Jaime goes through many scenes where he’s scared with his new superpowers, but then is having a blast when fighting baddies - almost like the movie wants to have grit and fun action at the same time but doesn’t do the effort to edit these things well. 

I’d probably be a lot less harsh on the movie if I’ve seen less than 5 superhero movies before and aren’t caught on with the clichés. But after seeing so many, I can’t take another one that just plays it safe and goes through all the conventions.",,2024-04-02

This is a really odd comedy. On one side, the concept of an undercover cop as a kindergarten teacher just yells elementary/family comedy. On the other hand, there’s many adult references here to give it a PG-13 rating. The fact that this was actually profitable in its box office run goes to show the star power of Arnold Schwarzenegger at his peak. I highly doubt this film could be made today. 

There were moments that I really appreciated and wished had more focus in the film. For example, Schwarzenegger’s brute anger towards a father that beats his child. Also, his policing disciplines implemented on kindergarteners. I wish the focus went more on these moments than the unnecessary crude humor. 
I would love to have another version of this movie with no crude humor so that it can actually be accessible to children. 

I also admittedly wasn’t that invested into the criminal aspect of the film.

2024-04-05,Moulin Rouge!,2001,https://boxd.it/6diglb,3,,"I don’t think I’ve been so conflicted on a movie review as much as this one. 

It has lots of elements that I thoroughly enjoy with a film. Catchy musical covers and wacky comedic elements always give me a smile. The setting is very unique and I couldn’t help but be charmed by it. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman undoubtedly have chemistry together and were the right choices for their roles. I will likely rewatch many musical elements on YouTube for years to come, especially “The Pitch”. 

Overall, I left the film feeling incomplete. I didn’t really understand the point of the whole film. Was it just supposed to be fun pizzazz, or is there a greater message here? I seem to feel this way with all Baz Luhrmann films I’ve watched so far - I am charmed, but the editing choices feel too random for me and prevented me from being invested in the story. On the other hand, I personally connect well with Wes Anderson’s wackiness because it feels better executed and in line with the story.

2024-04-07,Dumb and Dumber,1994,https://boxd.it/6e6r91,4.5,,"A consistent piece of joy from start to finish!

What worked very well here was the characterization of Harry and Lloyd. They really perfected the level of immaturity. They didn’t just act like six year olds or like bratty teenagers - they utilized certain silly qualities in perfectly matched scenarios. It almost felt like what the best improv scenes entail - find the gift, and capitalize all the humor around that gift. 
The inconsistency in behaviors, while normally would be a negative, were perfect here because it made their reactions that much more unpredictable and funny. 
I think the reason this worked so well for me was that the characterizations were juxtaposed with a criminal plot. There were criminals thinking that Harry and Lloyd were really smart crooks, and knowing that they really aren’t is hilarious. 

The look and feel of the film was charming too. Opening credits with incorrect spelling are little moments that set up the tone well. 

This film made me respect Jim Carrey more. Most of the films I’ve seen of his were “past his prime”. Seeing him during his prime timeframe made me really understand what people saw in him and how he got so many film opportunities and box office success. 

I do miss comedy films like this. Comedy films today seem to be overly raunchy and flashy, while at the same time trying to hold back to avoid getting canceled. I personally felt that this film is still very watchable today.

Everything about the main storyline with Monk’s career worked for me. The sarcastic comedic timing of Jeffrey Wright was unlike anything else I’ve seen. It was super funny to see his joke unbelievably grow out of control. I totally understood his frustration of getting pigeonholed into certain writing tropes based on the color of his skin. I think this brings forth a very fascinating conversation point for viewers of the film. 

This is the type of adult comedy I want to see more of. Most adult comedy these days is either overly raunchy or super political. The comedy here felt much more relaxing. 

Without spoiling anything, I thought the ending of the film was very smart, and I’m kinda surprised I haven’t seen this style of an ending in other films. 

What didn’t work for me as much was the storyline with Monk’s family and his relationship. Any time it cut to this really felt like a completely different movie, and I didn’t understand its inclusion. I enjoyed the character played by Traci Ellis Ross, but we don’t get much of her in the film. 
I also seriously didn’t like Sterling K. Brown’s character in the film. His characterization and actions just felt too unbelievable to me in the context of the rest of the family. The inclusion of this character almost felt like it had to fall into an Oscar bait trope for the film to be accepted, which to me felt like the opposite message that the main storyline was trying to convey.

2024-04-12,Rush,2013,https://boxd.it/6gcyFD,4,,"A surprisingly enjoyable thrill ride in the world of race car driving. 

I was admittedly not the most stoked into watching this film. I already saw very good race car movies that were based on true stories (<i>Ford v Ferrari</i> and <i>Gran Turismo</i>) so I was skeptical on if another film within this niche would really appeal to me. I decided to watch it because it was leaving Netflix soon, and my recent Hans Zimmer soundtrack listens kept bringing up music from this film. 

At the beginning I was admittedly not that interested. The leads were presented with cocky and toxic masculinity. On one side this presented some fun (albeit fake) trash reality television, but on the other hand I just didn’t think I would relate to their hurdles. 
As I was solidifying this thought, a certain accident occurred in the film. After this point, the film became much more interesting to me. It gave thrills through the rest of the runtime, and it provided strong depth to our lead characters. It was a relationship I didn’t expect to care about, and then suddenly did. 

The racing scenes were all filmed in a great thrilling manner. They did a good job of showing how dangerous the sport is, which increased the adrenaline rush.

After this film ended, I was interested enough to look up more about the real events and the lives of James Hunt and Niki Lauda. (Sidebar - I still find it hilarious that I never care for professional sports until I experienced a dramatized version of it on film). There were definitely creative liberties taken which deviated from the actual events. Normally this turns me off, because usually the actual events are more interesting to me than what we actually see. But in this case, I agreed with the creative liberties as it strengthened the relationship between our leads. I’m also at peace knowing that the real Niki Lauda approved of the film. 

I wish the film steered away from scenes with nudity. I understand this was included to emphasize the masculine nature of James Hunt, but I think that was effective already through the other ways the film presented. The nudity served no purpose other than preventing families from enjoying this film together.

2024-04-14,Civil War,2024,https://boxd.it/6gWKWj,4.5,,"Arguably one of the best movie concepts and executions I’ve ever seen. 

The concept of a modern day civil war in the US just screams divisiveness. I know that if the direction chosen was one with heavy political commentary, it would be lauded by half the population and criticized by the other half and none of the reviews would appropriately review the filmmaking. 
So I fully agree with the decision to avoid any political commentary here, and simply focus on the effects of what would happen if a civil war took place today. The decision to not reveal the motivations of the factions smartly worked here, because I think any viewer would universally assume that the situation could’ve been preventable, and it’s sad to see that the situation came to this. 

The best part is the direction of the violence. There are a plethora of superhero, action, and military films out there. But, this is one of the few that truly made me feel chilling and uncomfortable (the only main one I can think of that felt similar was the opening of <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>). I think this was partly because the violence scenes were not cinematic or glamorized. They were real gunshot sounds, and real injuries. 
But, I think the main reason I felt this way while watching was the fact that this was a civil war in America. It’s clear that these people were normal citizens that later became cutthroat individuals ready to snipe their neighbors. While the film never explains why they do what they do, you understand that they have to act this way or they will be killed by the enemy faction. 

Another choice I appreciated was filming this from the perspective of neutral journalists. In a way, this might have been the most unbelievable part of the film because journalism is obviously far from neutral today. The journalists in this film weren’t just neutral by name, but they literally don’t intervene with killings that occur so that they can portray the real story. It was really fascinating to see that juxtaposition. 

Great to see Kirsten Dunst again in a film. I really need to check out more of her filmography.

The best parts of the film were with Jesse Plemons. I wish the marketing didn’t focus so much on this actor’s existence so that it could’ve added that much more effect upon watching the film. 

What didn’t really work for me was the film’s ending with our main characters. Choices felt out of left field and abrupt. It seemed like the film was trying to make a statement with these choices. If that is the case, that almost feels like the film betrayed the choice from the earlier parts of the film to avoid political commentary.

I really appreciate that this film was not only set in the 1970s, but was filmed as if it was released in the 1970s. Historical films these days still have a glossy sheen on it that doesn’t feel genuine, but I didn’t feel that way here. 

When the film began with five boys staying in boarding school through the break, I expected this to be the type of film where kids of all cliques start to actually learn appreciative things about each other. While I have nothing against that type of film, we have seen a lot of those before. Once I learned it was more about just one boy and the relationship with other school staff, it went into unexpectedly charming directions. This teacher-student dynamic felt much more realistic than what we see in typical coming-of-age films. Little moments such as the DIY dessert from Paul and Mary to Angus gave me warm fuzzies. 

I appreciated how the characterization of Paul Giamatti’s character was kept consistent through the film. He has the same odd way with words and “unattractiveness”, but as you continue watching you grow to appreciate him as Angus does. 

As much as I enjoyed watching this, I don’t really see this film becoming a household rewatch tradition like <i>Home Alone </i>or <i>Planes, Trains, and Automobiles</i>. While the cursing in the film is realistic and not over-the-top, it’s enough to prevent children from watching it. While less flash is a nice breath of fresh air, the flip side of the coin is that it won’t have big meme-able moments to be memorable.

2024-04-15,Napoleon,2023,https://boxd.it/6hfimP,3,,"Any film I see of Ridley Scott will only make me more appreciative of his craft. He brings huge variety and quantity to the big screen, even at post-retirement age. A film like this seems like it can only be made with a high energy middle-aged director, so the fact that such an old person can still construct a huge historical war drama is nothing short of commendable. 

The production design of this film is tremendous. I genuinely felt like I was in the time period of this film, from the visual effects to costume design. An early scene involving a horse with a cannonball set me up for the brutal vibes I was about to endure. All battle sequences in the show were chillingly scary in a good way. Even if I didn’t follow along with story details, the visuals were entertaining enough through the runtime. 
Admittedly, all of this was also a good distraction to the fact that all the French people aren’t even talking French. This linguistic choice didn’t even take me out of the movie because the strong set design pulled me in. 

The odd choice here was that despite being a film with meticulously crafted detail to the time period and huge war battle set pieces, the main portion of this film is Napoleon’s toxic relationship with Josephine. I wanted to appreciate this choice for being against-type (and potentially being a unique way to understand Napoleon’s leadership motivations), but couldn’t get there. These moments felt more like unnecessary drama than juicy drama. I kept wanting to go back to the huge battle sequences. 

It seems many criticized the historical inaccuracies. Admittedly I don’t know this history closely enough to comment on that. Either way, I don’t think it’s as important of a negative compared to the choice to focus on the toxic relationship.

2024-04-18,Pinocchio,1940,https://boxd.it/6ivsYl,4.5,,"One of the few pieces of film that is actually timeless. 

Usually when I watch old films, I have to subconsciously add a buffer in interest. Live-action films would be in black-and-white, slow-paced, and visually not as captivating as today’s films. For this reason, I tend to stay away from films older than the 1980s. 
However, I don’t say the same for this film. In fact, a part of me wishes that animated films could go back to this style and simplicity. I was surprised by how captivated I was by the entertainment value, despite it being over 80 years old. 

My favorite part about this film is its simplicity. Today’s animated films are a much grander scale, with top-notch visuals and many characters and thorough world-building. On the other hand, this film is actually very contained. There really aren’t that many characters here. We aren’t even really shown much about the world itself. It is assumed that most of the world (besides the portions we see) mimic human life closely, so the film doesn’t waste time to show any of that. Instead, the film focuses on Pinocchio’s journey. In a way, this simplistic choice also worked because we traverse the world through Pinocchio’s lack of awareness. 

Given that Pinocchio is a household name known for his giant nose that gets bigger when he lies, I thought this would be utilized much more than what the film actually does. It was actually a bigger story about growing up in the right direction. The message is not only great but also an important universal message, which I why I believe the film is so timeless. 
But more than the appreciation of the message, above all else the film was an entertaining watch. The film here had a structure of an entertaining animated watch, which happened to have a good message. Animated films these days seem to have the opposite structure: determine the message, and form a film around that. I believe that is actually a negative because it has lead to lower quality entertainment and wouldn’t be as timeless anymore. 

This film made me feel super nostalgic about the old Tom and Jerry cartoons I used to watch. Despite the animation being old, it was still very entertaining. I’m now energized to explore more animations of the past.

2024-04-18,Cowboys & Aliens,2011,https://boxd.it/6ixW9L,1.5,,"A colossal misfire of a promising premise. 

This film seemed to have all the pieces needed for a huge box office hit. The literal James Bond and Indiana Jones together, directed by Jon Favreau (whose filmography I think has a wide variety of solid hits) with a giant budget and a western sci-fi premise. Not only does it have the resources, but it had a unique premise not really seen before. I would’ve expected everything about this to be awesome. 
I knew this was a box office bomb, but given all the pieces I was really hoping I could be on the side of the film. Unfortunately, it is difficult to defend. 

Everything about this just felt so generic. A few days later, I forgot many details about this film. I remembered a lot more about a 1940s Disney film and a Wes Anderson short. 
The set pieces felt normal. I didn’t feel like I was a part of the western world, which I expect with the amount of talent and budget here. 
The aliens also felt very generic too. Visually they were very normal. I wish we could get more fascinating details about the aliens, or get much less information about them to get a mysterious dread. 
The action wasn’t interesting enough for me to be thrilled with either. 

Something that also really didn’t fit in here was the use of amnesia in Daniel Craig’s character. Amnesia is such an overused plot device, and it didn’t really help here. He seemed to randomly remember convenient pieces of information and convenient plot moments. It didn’t add any intriguing mystery (such as in <i>The Bourne Identity</i>), it just added frustration.

Because it is a short, we don’t really get to explore as much as of the whimsical world or plot with this. That’s my only complaint. Maybe I’ll feel less critical if I explore his other Roald Dahl adaptations.",,2024-04-18
2024-04-21,The Sting,1973,https://boxd.it/6jDetN,4,,"I haven’t heard of this film until Netflix randomly brought this film to the front of my screen. I decided to watch this film because it was leaving Netflix soon and it was apparently a Best Picture winner. I went into it expecting to feel like “homework” just to complete the Best Picture winners. I ended up thoroughly enjoying this. 

This is a type of film that probably would never win Best Picture today. It doesn’t showcase innovative filmmaking or a greater message. It is simply a thrill ride amongst scammers trying to scam a mob boss. It has appeal to everyday audiences, not just the cinephiles.

Love the throwback story time feel this had, from the title cards to the ragtime music (especially <i>The Entertainer</i>). 

We first see our main character of Johnny Hooker as an obvious scammer. It’s pretty difficult to have the audience side with a person that committed a crime. But, seeing the deeper criminal underworld and exploring characterizations of Johnny Hooker and his counterparts made me want him to succeed. 

There was a twist reveal in the third act that I truly didn’t see coming.  

I thoroughly adored the poker shots in the film. It reminded me heavily of <i>Casino Royale</i>. Now I want to watch more poker shots in films. 

It was interesting to watch a film from the 1970s being a throwback film to the 1930s. I feel a like a film today that was set in the 1930s would have a much cleaner feel than the scrappy, lived-in world we see here.

2024-04-25,The Notebook,2004,https://boxd.it/6ligjr,3.5,,"A pretty solid romantic film with enough uniqueness to stand out, despite its narrative flaws. 

I was bought in through the first third of the film. While Noah’s first interaction seemed odd for me, I quickly bought into the chemistry between Noah and Allie. I understood the charm they had for each other, and why their social class differences caused the arguments they had. While I normally disapprove of sex scenes in films (and I also disapprove of the sex scenes in this film), this first one was filmed in a nervous and realistic manner which I appreciated. The beginning overall had the typical charms of a rom-com, while also bringing enough uniqueness with the setting and various creative choices. 

We get enough characterization from Allie to understand her dilemma between choosing two life partners. That is definitely key accept the confusions and arguments that occur. 

The film did a good job of depicting a 1940s romance for modern audiences. This brought some charm and refreshing nature to film. 
Although, a nitpick is that I didn’t think the 1940s were depicted super accurately. It doesn’t take away any of the impact of the film, but it was particular front of mind for me after watching <i>The Sting</i>. 

Once certain events cause the leads to become physically distant, I started rolling my eyes at choices that didn’t make much sense. For example, Allie’s mother goes strongly out of her way to prevent communication from Noah. But, this decision doesn’t really make sense when we later on learn something about Allie’s mother’s past. It seemed like these occurred as plot conveniences, rather than consistent reasoning. 
No, I don’t expect perfect logic in a rom-com (or any genre for that matter). But, this was a huge complication within the plot so I would’ve expected it to be more thought out. 
I’m sure I’m in the minority here. I’m someone that really hates the plot of Romeo and Juliet, even though mainstream people consider this to be the best love story every created.

This is a great example of a film that has awards buzz and is not a hugely budgeted film, but still one worth seeing on the big screen. 

Very well deserving of the Oscar for best sound. The film essentially takes place during the Holocaust from the perspective of a Nazi family. They live normal lives, but you occasionally hear Holocaust-related sounds in the background (and Holocaust-related minor visuals details). 
Sound was smartly utilized as a completely separate tone from what we are directly viewing on screen. Being a slight background sound was somehow more creepy than actually seeing what was happening in the background. 

It’s even more creepy when you see how tone-deaf the main characters are to the people suffering in the background. Our main characters were focusing on improving their garden and getting new lipstick from victims, while the victims in the background are basically getting murdered. Absolutely vile. 

This film feels less as a film and more as an experience. It reminded me of a time I was at the Civil Rights Museum in Atlanta: there was a simulation where you had to sit in a diner while hearing racial slurs typically heard in the 1950s. I did not last long there. But I’m glad that I went through that simulation to have some understanding of the tragedies of life in that time period. 

While I agree the experience in this film is important for all to go through, I don’t see it much more than an experience. A feature-length runtime was utilized with a plot that didn’t seem like it had importance to share, compared to the experience. I think this just needed to be a short film consisting of vignettes. 
That being said, the only reason this film would’ve gotten such attention is by being a feature film. It got lots of buzz and got nominated for many awards for this reason. A short film would only get nominated for the best short film, and not the other ones like sound. So I don’t blame that this film chose to go a feature length direction (and make an arguably worse “film”) rather than a short film direction to focus on just the experience.",,2024-04-25
2024-04-28,Midsommar,2019,https://boxd.it/6meoEt,2.5,,"A lot to appreciate from a filmmaking perspective, but the journey was not worth it. 

I will commend Ari Aster for making films that are super risky with a limited budget. Every film of his has unsettling natures that explore themes of trauma, but still vary so widely from each other. 
Personally, I don’t think he’s my cup of tea because ultimately I don’t enjoy the journey. 

As this film opened, I was very on board. The setup and filmmaking was perfect. 
The relationship our two leads were introduced with was so uniquely captured. This wasn’t just two people in a loving relationship, or a relationship where one of them is clearly in the wrong. This was a strained relationship where we as the audience don’t see major faults on either side, but at the same time understand why they have the negative conversations to each other. Setting up a complicated relationship like this is very difficult, but I was able to completely understand this complex relationship. 
The trauma that our lead character, Dani, was experiencing was completely understandable too. It can be difficult to convey trauma to audiences that haven’t experienced the exact trauma that the character did, but I think this was done in a way where anyone can sympathize. 
Certain shots of the film that are normally simple shots were done in a fascinating manner (which continued through the rest of the runtime). Conversations happened across mirror shots, rather than both people actually being in camera. Camera pans were done in disorientingly well crafted directions. While I normally don’t like the horror genre, the unsettling nature of these shots were so artistically crafted that I had to appreciate them and see how the film goes forward with this setup. 

Even once our characters arrive to the cult in Sweden, I was on board to see it out. The visuals of the commune had beautiful symmetrical shots. 
Normal horror films contain an ensemble of people that all love each other or all hate each other or one scapegoat. This ensemble was much more complex, with some people actually being friends while others feeling an obligation to not instigate anything. Yet, all of this relationship complexity is clearly communicated to the audience. 
The scene involving grass on Dani was very unsettling. I appreciate that this film doesn’t do a bunch of gore for a similar reaction. There was a lot of thought put into how to craft this. It makes you feel that there is a lot to appreciate in the art, but it is still unsettling because it looks so wrong. 
Many unsettling setups and relationships were well crafted to make me really want to know what the film would do with these puzzle pieces. 

The second half of the film completely lost me. It leaned so much into shocking and nauseating horror without much purpose other than shock value. Without spoiling anything, the only horror elements I liked here were the visuals of dead bodies because they managed to be super creepy without the super gorey conventions. But other than that, I just don’t understand the purpose of this film. The setup was meticulously crafted with unique complexities, and I felt they didn’t get payoff in the end. 

I could see huge horror fans appreciating this more than me, but other than that I don’t understand how this film is so popular from others.",,2024-04-27

This has been on my list for far too long, finally got around to it because I was tasked to watch an underdog story for my improv class this week. It has a classic underdog feel, but also has so much more to offer. 

The easy criticism is that this is a 2000 Disney film, so it follows a typical formula that simplifies the topic of 1970s racism and avoids the darker sides of history. I don’t disagree per se, but I think what we see is fresh and important. The time period is after the Civil Rights Act, but still when racist sentiments clearly exist. So we see adults feeling nervous about white and black people in the same towns and schools. What I found most interesting is that we see the kids initially have these same sentiments, but then become the drivers of equality once they get to know each other. This was done very well, and filmed in a believable manner too. 
This film also does a good job of not making white people appear completely evil. Unfortunately I think a film made today would do this wrong. Here, we just see white people feel nervous at first but then open up to it later. 
Overall, while racism was a lot uglier than what we see in this film, we see enough of it to show kids about the terrible past we had, while also not overtaking feelings of pity through the film. 

This film also did a great job of educating themes through sports. The prime theme shown was that teammates need to work together to be a successful team. To do that, they have to put aside their racial differences to collaborate. Sports was a great way to educate this theme because sports is a venue where clear talent will win. One of my favorite scenes was when high school athletes learned this lesson naturally by wanting to win a practice run. 
Julius and Gerry’s friendship was the most heartwarming aspect to me. They go from enemies to friends, and that arc felt completely natural. 

I appreciated that this didn’t shoehorn romantic subplots. The focus of the film is correctly on the sports and the racism, and romance would’ve detracted. 

I have two nitpicks. 
First, I didn’t understand the choice of making Ronnie Bass a hippie. It seemed like an additional checkbox to add to this film unnecessarily. In addition, upon looking up the real character, he was nothing like this. 
Second, I would’ve liked to see more struggle from Coach Boone’s character. We see him say couple instances of struggle in his past while coaching the kids, but we don’t see much more. He almost appears like a perfect character that never makes mistakes and never has negative emotions. This is great as a coach, but I wanted to see more of him behind the scenes on what motivated him.",,2024-05-01

Sometimes I tell myself that I’m too nice to certain movies, granting positive reviews to films that maybe don’t deserve it. As I tell myself this, I then come across movies like this that are so bad that I appreciate mediocre movies as being “competent enough”. 

This is a typical Telugu masala movie with a couple cute funny scenes, but all tarnished with stupid plot decisions. 

A “mystery” in the movie is set up as waiting to figure out the heroine’s defense for a misunderstanding. This is set up near the beginning of the film but not addressed at any capacity until the tail end, and that too isn’t fully explained. There are many other cases of setup and improper payoff like this. 

Ok done with actual reviewing, now I’m just going to stage actual scenes that happened in this film:
The hero wants to teach a lesson to his nieces and nephews on how to handle people that threaten your family. He does so by threatening to rape the women of the bad guy’s family.

I thought the first Aquaman film was fine - I loved how crazy the underwater world was (e.g. octopus drummer), and I loved the surfer bro vibe of Jason Momoa in the lead. But, there wasn’t much more that popped in the first film for me to give a strong positive recommendation. 

This film seemed to have similar contents, but was much more conventional. Not enough world-building exploration of the underwater world. Humor that was bad versions of MCU quips, rather than leaning in more into Jason Momoa surfer bro vibes. Heroes and villains with many CGI army helpers that seemingly shoot up out of nowhere. 

This film also suffers from being created after <i>Avatar: The Way of Water</i> was released. That had top-notch underwater fight scenes, while this one didn’t feel as epic. 

One brief shot made me really wish James Wan had full creative control of this film. There was a jump scare shot of a frozen skeleton within ice in an underwater exploration. It was a creative and effective jump scare. Also, an underwater zombie film sounds absolutely bonkers enough to be amazing. 

I admittedly don’t remember much lore of Aquaman from the previous DCEU installments, but it seems to not matter at all here. To be fair, seemed like the DCEU didn’t care either, as they are just getting ready for a reboot. 

Nothing in the film was really wrong per se, but it was way too conventional and we needed something more in the era of superhero fatigue to be interested.

2024-05-06,Minari,2020,https://boxd.it/6q1TwF,3.5,,"A unique perspective of hard-working immigrants settling into the United States. 

I tend to not relate to films depicting immigrants in the US, because they seem to focus on weird things. A lot of them are depicted from the perspective of the kids who wish to deviate from the culture of their parents, with the film’s messaging being that the culture direction is incorrect. Or these films depict stereotypic quotes that just feel unrealistic. 
Thankfully, this film didn’t go that direction. 

From the beginning, we are rooting for the best for this family. Jacob has big dreams and we root for his success. He risked it all to move to Arkansas to live in a weird home, start up a farm from scratch to make Korean produce typically not found in the US, and stayed as frugal as possible while still ensuring his family is supported. This is the type of immigrant story that needs to be depicted more in film. 
This film easily could’ve leaned into racism struggles of the immigrant family, but I think it was the right decision to focus on how they were assimilating into Arkansas life and the struggles associated with that. 

This film chose to go a direction of including other seemingly unrelated vignettes about each of the family members. I think the goal of this was to show how this is an everyday family that experiences struggles of holding the family together while trying to pursue the American Dream. But, I felt the runtime focused too much on these areas without providing a greater purpose. This made the journey a bit boring, even if I did relate to the characters well.",,2024-05-05

It hurts me to report that I didn’t like this film. 

The story behind the creation of this film is fascinating. It was an actual underdog tale of a passionate Dev Patel literally putting everything he had on the line to film this and Jordan Peele supporting a theatrical run for the film. 
From the marketing, it seemed like the film had everything I would love in a film. An action thriller with brutal stunt work, the joy of supporting a small budget film in theaters, and a welcome exposure of Hinduism to international audiences. 

Unfortunately, this was tough for me to sit through. 

I’m really shocked that most audiences are positive with this film. My guess is that the India underworld setting is “fresh” for western audiences. Personally, this isn’t fresh for me given my long exposure to many Telugu masala films having such content. 

The marketing made it seem like this film is nonstop action. In reality, there are only two (albeit long) action scenes. I have no problem with that - one of my favorite films last year was <i>The Killer </i>which only had action scene. But that film worked for me because even that one action scene was thrilling, and more importantly the rest of the film had a gripping nature to be invested. In this film, I needed more to root for how brutal the protagonist was willing to go for revenge. 
The use of heavy shaky cam was definitely good at making the whole setting feel chaotic, but it also made it hard to track what was going on in some moments. I understand that such stunt direction occurred to be creative through budget constraints, but to truly appreciate stunt work I have to like it regardless of knowing production background for a film. 

Given all this, I don’t see a particular reason to view this in theaters. On that note, I’m not a die-hard of Jordan Peele’s film work, and I’m surprised that mass audiences treat him in the same regard as those like Steven Spielberg. I love Jordan Peele, but I’m not convinced he has a genius filmmaking brain.

2024-05-09,Mad Max,1979,https://boxd.it/6rjsnL,2.5,,"This is a really confusing review to do now. I’m sure my opinion on this will completely change in the future, so I will just throw my thoughts down now. 

My background before this point was only watching <i>Mad Max: Fury Road</i>. I really loved the practical effect set pieces in that movie. My plan is to watch the rest of the franchise before <i>Furiosa</i> comes out. 

From the second this film started, I was very confused about if this even is the same universe as <i>Mad Max: Fury Road</i>. I get that this film had barely any budget and no plans for a franchise, so it’s like comparing apples and oranges. But as a comparison, I think it’s pretty evident that the original <i>Star Wars</i> film is in the same universe as every other property after it: costume design, space travel, lightsabers are all the same in all these films. Only difference is the budget. 
<i>Mad Max: Fury Road</i> had many crazy people in wild costumes off-roading through deserts. On the other hand, pretty much everything in this film occurred in actual towns on actual paved roads. In addition, Max is introduced as a normal family man that is also a cop here. Overall not a crazy world. 

I was admittedly kinda bored through the runtime, because many car chases and crashes were very simplistic and didn’t have much obvious stakes or motive behind them. I later on looked up the production of this film and was pretty impressed retroactively: I had no idea that George Miller was a doctor and then decided to make a film with injuries that he saw as a doctor. And then illegally filmed shots on roads and was only allowed one take to do them due to budget restraints. Clearly there were risks taken to produce this film so I have to commend that. 

It really isn’t until the last few minutes when Max is truly “mad”. Which is funny to think about. This is the part where I really got on board, but most of the film had to go through to get to this point. 
After I see the rest of the franchise, I may end up really appreciating this film as a solid origin story. Until then, I’ll keep this feeling for my review.

2024-05-11,Pete's Dragon,2016,https://boxd.it/6s2chn,2.5,,"Not a bad watch, but not super praiseworthy either. 

I was looking forward to watch this film because it deviated from the Disney assembly line content. Unlike all the live-action adaptations that are remaking classic animations, this one was a remake of a property that was not as popular. I am all for remakes of “bad” or “unpopular” films to add a modern take and provide a fresh perspective. 
Unfortunately, there isn’t enough here for me to champion the film. 

While this film went through all the typical Disney tropes, they were all properly executed and evoked the proper emotions at each beat. The child actor is undoubtedly charming. 
The opening scene was also great, getting similar emotions as the opening of <i>Up</i>. While it felt very similar to <i>The Jungle Book </i>(which is funny timing that both live-action adaptations were in 2016), it’s a good formula so I was ready for it. 

What didn’t work for me here was the messy writing. Especially with the antagonist - He acted well, but his motive seemed to change conveniently at plot moments. Robert Redford’s character was initially not a major character, but then suddenly got very involved in the third act.
Normally I don’t have high expectations for sharp writing, but here it just took me out of the experience.

And despite analyzing them to death through our assignments, I barely remember much about them. All I remembered about this content was that a car accident happened at some point, and it took place around the 1920s. 

This film was only on my watchlist because of (a) Amitabh Bachchan’s Hollywood appearance and (b) Baz Luhrmann’s flashiness. I appreciate Baz Luhrmann as he has a style that elevated <i>Romeo + Juliet </i>and <i>Moulin Rouge! </i>but it didn’t work for me for <i>Elvis</i>. 

Overall, I felt Baz Luhrmann’s style was a perfect fit for this story and definitely elevated my liking for the film. It was definitely deserving of awards for Production Design and Costume Design, everything was lovely to look at. 

But, separating out the flash, I still found the story to be very boring and uninteresting. At the end of the day, the story is just a typical surface-level romance plot whose complications are easily avoidable if people just had a simple conversation with each other. The complications didn’t feel like a fun journey at all.

2024-05-16,Her,2013,https://boxd.it/6u0IJ3,5,,"This has been on my watchlist for a while, but definitely had to see it right after OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4o presentation and the Google I/O Gemini presentation. Those showed the conversationalism of their AI assistants, which is the crux of this film. 

At the time of its release, the film was not really viewed as a creepy horror film. This was probably because the concept of people conversing so casually with an AI is too unrealistic to believe this is an actual world. How could an AI ingest all your emails, contact other people on your behalf, and even have a relationship?
Now in the post-ChatGPT area, this feels like a very real future. It’s creepy, but at the same time I can’t help but commend how well the filmmakers realized this world 10 years ago (even before AirPods became a thing).

On that note, the world of this film has a lot to commend. This isn’t a world with flying cars or anything. It’s a slightly future world, so it still has the some of the same things like metros. But at the same time, it’s a fully realized world. We just happen to see Joaquin Phoenix’s character as the protagonist, but we see all the background characters also have hands-free conversations (presumably with their own conversational AIs) in public. The slice of life nature of this film is very refreshing compared to traditional sci-fi films. 

While I normally don’t like overly sexual inclusions in films, here I think it was necessary. At the time of this film, there was a lot of fear around people spending lots of their time on the internet. Now, the fear is definitely higher with conversational AI. I could definitely see a social world like this occur if AI is left unhinged. 

I felt it was very smart to cast Joaquin Phoenix in the lead role with such a personality. He is by no means the classic hot romantic lead type. He is aggressively normally and a bit awkward, but still has enough charm to grip the audience. It would make sense for a person of this type to find interest in a romantic relationship with an AI.

2024-05-18,Mad Max 2,1981,https://boxd.it/6uDiRt,5,,"A solid action thriller!

The previous films I saw in this franchise are <i>Mad Max: Fury Road </i>and <i>Mad Max</i>. Seeing the original made me greatly question if it truly was part of the franchise, but I figured it was just a drawn out origin story of Max. This film not only reassured me what the franchise is about, but it is absolutely epic. Sequels like this are so welcome because they are technically a possible continuation in the franchise, but make the effort to offer something new. 

My favorite part about this film is the world-building. Most franchises throw lots of exposition to explain the rules of the world (e.g. prophecies, superpowers). This film might be the most effective world-building I’ve seen in that there is no exposition - everything is just shown and inferred. It’s a simple world - a post-apocalyptic world with no law and order. We just go straight to the action. This film knows the film it’s trying to be and goes straight to it. 
The lack of dialogue works for the better here, we don’t need to grasp every detail of why people act the way they do. And as a result of not needing to focus so much on exposition, we got really efficient storytelling. This film is less than 100 minutes, and I felt like I saw so much action in that time. 
The simplicity in the world-building is really smart for two main reasons. 
First, it elevates our view of the main character. Max isn’t someone with superpowers or randomly appointed to become the chosen one. He is just someone with a sad past that is simply surviving the crazy world. We know he is still alive alone because he is talented enough with his skills to fend off enemies, and that is enough to root for him. 
Second, I don’t feel the need to watch films in order. All other franchises require you to do the homework to watch films in order to get the proper setup and payoff. Based on all the films I’ve seen in the franchise thus far, I don’t have a need to search up wikis of every character and/or object. All the films seem to just be adventures that happen in a simply explained post-apocalyptic world. I can just relax and enjoy all these films. 

It’s super interesting to compare this film to <i>Mad Max: Fury Road</i>. In almost every way it’s the same film with crazy contraptions on cars chasing each other, just with a generational difference of movie effects. I feel that both can still exist in the same universe because this film takes a dirtier and less cinematic route. Ultimately I like both of these takes equally. 
I initially expected <i>Mad Max: Fury Road</i> to be ten times wilder than others in the franchise. This film was just as wild, with a solo helicopter contraption and flamethrower and everything. 

In a time of film when everything has an overuse of CGI, this type of world is very refreshing. It’s all scrappy lifestyles, with monster trucks as gates to a civilization instead of an automatic door. 

The twist at the end was something I totally didn’t expect, which is commendable considering how old this film is. 

The only other films I can think of that try to copy the formula of this film is the Fast & Furious franchise. I retroactively probably don’t appreciate the Fast & Furious franchise as much anymore because this franchise nails raw actiony chaos way better. 

This film has been hailed as one of the best action films of all time. Going into a film with such expectations is dangerous, but I genuinely can’t find any faults with this. Time will tell if I still feel this positive about this film, but for now I agree with all the hype.",,2024-05-17

What made the experience extra frustrating for me is that this had the pieces to stand out amongst the superhero fatigue. Madame Web’s superpower of inconsistently seeing glimpses of the future is fascinating. That alone is enough to drive a whole film. A whole act to figure out how to master the superpower, and eventually using wits to defeat a supervillain. 
Dakota Johnson was even perfectly cast as Madame Web. The three teenage girls were also perfectly cast. 
But, the film chose to go in the most conventional directions ever. 

I genuinely never cared about any character in this film. It was hard to, with haphazard editing and plot choices. The last thing any sane person would do after nearly getting killed is to bring attention to themselves by dancing on a table in a diner. Countless moments like this were just unforgivable. 

It truly seemed like this film was made out of obligation. I don’t understand how such projects get greenlit to theaters. It should’ve been pretty obvious during production that no one cared here. If everyday audiences laugh at the acting and dialogue in the film, shouldn’t studio executives catch that and prevent its release?",,2024-05-19
2024-05-25,The Iron Claw,2023,https://boxd.it/6xCbQj,4,,"A continuously tragic biopic of the wrestling careers of the von Erich family. 

I am totally not into wrestling or boxing (or any fighting sports) but somehow I accept them in film. I also knew absolutely nothing about the true story, so all the story beats were very gut-wrenching to me. 

Huge respect to Zac Efron - he has done very well at transforming from Disney Channel beginnings to a respectable actor. He was almost unrecognizable here with his physique. He clearly put in a lot of physical and mental work into this film, and I’d argue very deserving of awards recognition. He not only had the physique of a wrestler but the emotional beats, and it is difficult to do both. Without spoiling anything, the end of the film is totally gut-wrenching. 

The father figure was a unique personality I haven’t seen before. You can clearly see his actions can lean to areas of abuse and overworking, but at the same time you get why his sons respect him. 

One aspect that felt odd to me is how easy it seemed for every brother to have a chance at the world championship. I personally view sports as the one place where you genuinely have to earn your position because the talent is clearly measurable. So the thought of another brother casually deciding to join the sport felt odd. 

I don’t really view this overall as a must-see, there are other sports dramas that offer more. 

This film also felt slightly over in its runtime.",,2024-05-24
2024-05-30,In the Heights,2021,https://boxd.it/6zN3t7,3.5,,"A musical time-pass. 

I always have a soft spot for musicals, so I’ve been looking forward to watch this film. I’m admittedly not a huge Hamilton fan (and to be honest, I don’t know how it’s so popular), but Lin-Manuel Miranda’s musical writing is very commendable and I was intrigued by the vibrancy from the trailers. I went blind going into this, as I knew nothing about the Broadway show. 

I can report that this film lived up well to what the trailers marketed. The fast-paced musical numbers had infectious energy (and thank goodness for subtitles allowing me to follow along with the lyrics). All the actors ooze in charisma through their characters. While plays aren’t my artistic cup of tea, I love how this film kept some stage presence choreography. 
Musicals seem to accomplish the impossible of making the runtime fly by, even though plot development is essentially stopped when a musical number occurs. I think this is possible when the energy of the musical is strong, and it totally is here. 
My favorite musical numbers were the ones that involved many people - I just wanted to join the party they were having. 

I think the only other John M. Chu film I’ve seen is <i>Crazy Rich Asians</i>. The vibrancy of cultures and set pieces in this film felt flashingly similar to <i>Crazy Rich Asians</i>. Overall, great choice to have John M. Chu direct. 

The utilization of a primarily Dominican ethnic presence was very unique. I normally avoid commending diversity for the sake of diversity, but it was very enjoyable to dip into the lens of a new culture for me. 

There were multiple plot choices that felt out of place. All were moments that seemingly had hints of relatability to modern political themes. After watching the film, I researched about the original musical, and in fact all these plot choices were changes from the original musical. Time will tell if the choice of political leanings will bode well for the legacy of this film, but overall I think the choices made plot developments worse and I wish the original film choices were kept.",,2024-05-29

Three A-list actresses as scheming air hostesses is a super fun premise. It’s clear that the actresses loved being a part of this project. I was overall on board with all the plot choices made here. 

A couple things didn’t work for me perfectly. 
Mainly, there is a lot of adult humor that didn’t land well. The premise itself is hilarious, and I wish the comedic moments focused on the plot instead of insignificant sidebars. Improving this piece of it would’ve easily made this a fun adventure for the whole family. 

The pacing isn’t fast-paced. The premise was enough for me to stick around until the end of the film. But, a faster pace would’ve made this feel more thrilling. 

A nitpick is that there is a fair amount of unrealism to buy into. This isn’t a major con for me, since the concept of air hostesses doing schemes is unrealistic in itself. But, I had enough of these thoughts to point it out.",,2024-05-30
2024-06-03,1917,2019,https://boxd.it/6Bx4KT,5,,"This has been on my list for too long to watch on at least of television screen, so I quickly jumped to watch it on Netflix once it arrived there. I was afraid of having too high expectations, but I ended up still thoroughly enjoying it. 

Many criticisms seem to highlight the fact that this film was just surface level and don’t explore as much war themes as other war films. I very much disagree with this as a criticism, because I saw this more as a thriller than a war film. I think too much exploration of deep war themes would have taken away the great gift that this film had. 
In my opinion, a war setting was perfect for this screenplay. Just by being set in a war zone in the middle of World War I, we know that walking a short distance alone is an adventure with constant danger. We didn’t need to waste exposition time to grasp this fact. 

Many (including myself) have been disappointed with films based on video games because the film ends up feeling like an assembly line production instead of capturing the same adrenaline rush feelings of the source material. The choice of making it all see like one shot wasn’t just a gimmick but a thrill in the way that video games feel like. We feel like we’re held into a fixed perspective of these characters on a journey, and experience their sufferings that never get a break. When long one-shots happen, I typically have the need to focus on if it was a well edited one-shot, instead of just enjoying the scenes of the film. Here, I barely had the crisp eyesight on the editing techniques because I was busy appreciating the journey of the film. 

I think what really sold this film for me was our lead characters (and their actors seriously deserved awards consideration). They were not superheroes with powers, but regular people with a “simple” goal. In many ways, I’m sure all audience members see a little of themselves suffering to try reaching their goal.
It was particularly wise to have one of the lead characters be someone that was kinda forced into the situation with no personal stakes. One would think that personal stakes are important, but here it added a layer of feeling that he really didn’t deserve to suffer the amount he is. 

This adventure will be thrilling for anyone, and I highly recommend a watch at your earliest convenience!",,2024-06-02
2024-06-06,Godzilla Minus One,2023,https://boxd.it/6CDwb9,4.5,,"Wow. 

I obviously heard all the hype around this film, but I was still very skeptical on how a Godzilla film could really be that amazing. A random monster wreaking havoc could only be so entertaining, right? 
The only Godzilla film I’ve seen before was the 2014 Hollywood film, which I enjoyed but wouldn’t rave about. I never explored any of the lore from the international productions (and wow there are so many). 

After finally watching the film, I understand the hype. 

I heard that the characters were the best part of the film, but I really wasn’t prepared for just how well the characters were developed. 
The protagonist’s characteristics were the perfect choice for this film. He’s not a macho hero. In fact, he’s the opposite. He starts off as a coward. I really only remember protagonists that maybe start out evil and then go through a redemption arc. Starting as a coward was a wise choice because it made him have opportunity for redemption, yet still deserve the audience to root for him. 
The family dynamic was surprisingly relatable too. Most Hollywood productions will have a love story grow amidst a disaster, which is so unrealistic and feels obligatory. Here, the family isn’t even a biological family, but fate brought them together to have familial relationships. The relationships were strong because you could tell that each member needed each other for strength. Their humanistic natures told them it was their duty to care for each other. The continuation of this familial nature through the rest of the film was so strong and touching. 
I almost view this film as a human nature film that happens to have Godzilla in it, rather than a Godzilla disaster movie. The classic statement from critics is that the characters are the most important part of the story. Flesh out the characters, rather than the spectacle. This film follows that rule with flying colors. 
Bringing Godzilla as the villain into this story was smart. A token superhero movie would have had a supervillain eventually kidnap the wife and kids of the hero, so that the hero gets angry and lead to a giant third act battle. Here, Godzilla was more a venue to provide a character arc for the protagonist. In a way, that made Godzilla even scarier and made us want to root for the protagonist more. 

It was also very smart to set this film right after World War II. Japan was obviously still weak and broken at this point, still recovering from the war. So battling a giant nuclear monster right after human enemies is super demotivating. However, the motivation for everyone came in a patriotic sense for protecting the land for their loved ones, rather than for their government. It was really refreshing to hear patriotic vibes like this, rather than surface-level statements. 

The one flaw for me was with the third act resolutions. I understand why the choices can make symbolic sense, but to me they sacrificed the realism that was earned from the first two acts. 

Very commendable that this film was made on such a low budget - Hollywood should take notes. This also proves that A-list star power isn’t required. 

I initially thought that the “Minus Color” version of the film was just a blatant cash grab. It probably is, but I fully understand how a black-and-white version of this film would be even more epic. 

Can someone tell me what “Minus One” means from the title? I genuinely don’t understand that.",,2024-06-05
2024-06-08,Beverly Hills Cop,1984,https://boxd.it/6D7gX7,4,,"A fun action comedy!

Despite this film being many years ago, it still feels pretty fresh. I understand why Eddie Murphy was a big star back in the day, if he had performances like this one. He elevated an otherwise conventional plot into something more. My favorite moments were whenever Eddie Murphy acted brash but smart.

The film doesn't really execute any amazingly enough to recommend or be hyped about its subsequent films, but it is a solid watch for anyone wanting an action comedy.

The ""Axel F"" song is so overused here, but I bopped to it every time it came up so I didn't mind it at all.

I got real surprised that Jonathan Banks was in this film, didn't even recognize him. It was only when I subsequently Google'd when I realized who he was. Wow, looks so different from his Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul moments!

This film was apparently one of the highest grossing films of its year. I wish we could go back to a time like this, where mid-budget surprise hits could be possible. Now, the highest grossing films are ones that are big budget sequels or big budget IP projects. I would love to experience a mid-budget surprise in the theater with many strangers.

2024-06-10,Uunchai,2022,https://boxd.it/6E8VTr,4,,"What a heartwarming, unique tale!

This has been on my list for a while. I adore anything Amitabh Bachchan does - unlike most Indian actors, he manages to both have a huge range in projects and actually acts his age. Also huge respect to Boman Irani and Anupam Kher, they also have had solid careers.
But most importantly, the concept of this film is beautiful. The idea of three old men hiking Mount Everest is beautiful. 

The film lived up to its concept by providing many heartwarming moments. Any time I saw the three of them pushing themselves to continue on the hike, I got emotional. Any of us will see our own grandparents in these three men and get inspired.
I wish more films like this can become profitable. Unfortunately, the masses want to see more flash with young people in their films, even if they lack personality.

This film is also definitely very long. I usually scorn when a film goes past 2.5 hours. But here, the warmth of witnessing our leads overcoming barriers continued to feel fresh for me so I didn't mind the runtime.
Although, the main criticism for me was a lot of unnecessary subplots. I understand fleshing out the personalities of the three men, as they had great chemistry together. But, the film chose to include a lot more information about all of them that ultimately didn't feel that relevant. I was gripped enough with the three of them banding together.

The personalities amongst the 3 of them were very fun and they had great chemistry. But, there were moments when the humor got too silly to be juxtaposed with the strenuous hikes. Less humor during these moments could've made the journey a lot more believable.

The film chose to open the film with a scene of them hiking, and then flashing back to their backstories of why they got there. A nitpick, but I felt this was an odd choice. We see their pushbacks for why they cannot do this trip, but knowing that they eventually overcome these pushbacks almost made me not as invested about them and I just wanted to cut back to Mount Everest.

2024-06-10,Fighting with My Family,2019,https://boxd.it/6E8Wtp,4.5,,"A solid sports film, elevated by a great blend of humor from the main family. 

I’ve seen many sports films recently (e.g. every film in the Rocky/Creed franchise) and I keep thinking I’ll get sick of the genre. Somehow I still haven’t - this might be my new guilty pleasure genre. 

The best part of this film is how it’s able to blend its silly humor into a sports film. Usually, this is a turn-off (e.g. the worst offenses of the MCU). Here, it works because the main family is so chaotically weird as caricatures that I wanted to keep seeing more of them (in particular, every interaction with the girlfriend’s parents - Stephen Merchant and Julia Davis - were too funny). At the same time, we could easily relate to all the family beats. For this reason, I think this is a sports film that is able to be accessible to all audiences. It has all the sports beats without the overly masculine aspects. 

My god, Florence Pugh. She has so much range across all her filmography. I will genuinely put her amongst the greats like Leonardo DiCaprio. I believed all of her actions as a wannabe wrestler and all the emotional struggles that come with it. I even believed her as someone that is a natural goth, even though she obviously is not. 

Even after watching this film, I still don’t understand the concept of staged wrestling. It made me question the point of some training montages and why certain people got cut.

2024-06-12,Tower Heist,2011,https://boxd.it/6F4RL5,4,,"A surprisingly fun comedy heist adventure!

I didn’t really know what to expect going into this film, but it’s been on my watchlist for a while. Any time I kept trying to watch it, it would get off the streaming service. This time I decided to just watch it before it comes off Netflix again. 
I did not realize how stacked this cast was (Matthew Broderick, Casey Affleck, Tea Leoni, etc.). And every cast member is having a blast on screen. I’m kinda surprised I haven’t heard of this film much as a cult following. 

Ben Stiller was my favorite part of the film. From the beginning, I felt his passion for his role with the building manager role. It made his motive for the heist believable rather than obligatory. It even made me believe the setup (even through ludicrous details).

Seeing this film right after <i>Beverly Hills Cop</i>, I felt like I was just watching Eddie Murphy’s typical fun character again. I didn’t realize that this was a welcome addition amongst reviews because Eddie Murphy had a break from these types of characters. I retroactively can understand why Eddie Murphy’s character could excite people. 

As the runtime continued, some details became inconsistent and started causing faults in my mind. For example, while the existence of the characters of Matthew Broderick and Tea Leoni were very fun, they didn’t really make much sense for the plot. Also, building hanging in the third act got way too ludicrous. 

I still strongly prefer heist films like <i>Ocean’s Eleven </i>and <i>The Italian Job</i>, but this is a good watch if you want more of a silly vibe with your heists.",,2024-06-11

I really liked the setup in this film. A teenager with a plethora of medical issues that starts to question her mother’s caretaking. I was very glad with certain details being properly executed, all rooted from the casting of Kiera Allen. Not only is she a great actress, but she actually cannot walk. This made all crawling and wheelchair scenes look believable because she has done that her whole life. 

The later half ended up going through the typical psychological thriller beats. This alone wouldn’t be a criticism for me, but there was also a weird relaxation of perfecting all the details. Convenient newspaper article placements and stupid behaviors from side characters took effect near the end. They didn’t make me hate the film, but it was definitely a step down from the premise. 

I will still fully support Aneesh Chaganty’s next adventures, but likely won’t watch this one again.",,2024-06-13
2024-06-16,Schindler's List,1993,https://boxd.it/6Gs62p,5,,"Finally, I’ve experienced this film. Spielberg is my favorite director, yet I haven’t seen this until now. I’ve heard all the praise about this film being one of his best. How this man made this and <i>Jurassic Park</i> in the same year. How you haven’t really understood the harrowing nature of the Holocaust until this film. 
I finally got here. And despite all the impossible praises of the film, I agree with all the praise. 

The serious side of Spielberg is admittedly still new to me. I closely associate him with iconic blockbusters. <i>Saving Private Ryan </i>is the only recent serious film of his that I’ve seen that has opened my eyes on what he is able to accomplish. I didn’t think it was possible for him to go beyond that. Turns out, he did with this film. 

Thank you, Steven Spielberg, for educating me about this point of history. It’s obviously one thing to hear about the unforgivable nature of Hitler and Anne Frank’s diary explaining what it was like to be in hiding. But visually seeing the behavior of Nazi officers on the Jews was disgusting. 

I really loved the choice of making this a black and white film. It somehow made everything much more horrific. It did not make the film less interesting, as I expected going into it. 

I really liked the portrayal of Oskar Schindler here. Yes, everyone views him as a hero. But it was important to show his beginnings. At the beginning, he was purely a businessman that was profiting from Jewish labor. You could tell that he knew horrific things were happening to Jewish people, but at the time didn’t do anything about it until he could see a profit from it. This was an important display of an everyday person’s complicit nature through the genocide. 
This beginning portrayal also made his emotional breakdown near the end much more impactful, knowing that he genuinely could’ve done more.
Wow, I didn’t know there was this side of Liam Neeson. He is now in the same throwaway action film every few months, but now I see what is seriously capable of. As much as I love Tom Hanks, Liam Neeson seriously deserved the Oscar for Best Actor. What a snub. 

Also a snub was Ralph Fiennes for Best Supporting Actor. Now I understand why he got cast as Lord Voldemort eventually. This villainous scum made my blood boil for every second he was on screen. The amount of throwaway death caused by this man was jarring. 

I watched <i>The Zone of Interest</i> earlier this year. Yes, that is a jarring look at the Holocaust. But I couldn’t help but feel like something was missing from that film. On the other hand, everything was present here. A captivating story capturing all the gross offenses through the Holocaust. The long runtime didn’t feel long at all - it felt necessary to capture everything.

I’m pretty surprised how many people didn’t like this. I felt all the emotional beats that the short wanted me to. I don’t think I’ve felt grief as closely to a main character as this one. 
Given the super short runtime, I will probably want to rewatch this with someone else to discuss the depiction of grief here. I thought it was captured very well, and I’m curious what other people would feel. 

My only flaw is that I’m not sure what the goal is (other than depicting grief). This is a criticism I have of many shorts - I wish it was longer to flesh some of this out. I’m sure there are financial barriers preventing longer runtimes from creators. But, I can’t help but feel like something more needed to be communicated from here and it just didn’t.",,2024-06-16
2024-06-19,Inside Out 2,2024,https://boxd.it/6HL6kl,4.5,,"I had very mixed feelings going into this one. <i>Inside Out </i>is one of my favorite films ever. It taught me that feeling emotions other than joy is normal and valuable to grow. I still look back to those themes today whenever I feel down. Also, the end of that film tied up with a great bow of memories with mixed emotions. 
I was afraid that a sequel could undo some of the themes and growth of <i>Inside Out</i>. Also, the idea of more emotions seemed to undo the idea of mixed emotions at the end of the first film. 

I admittedly still prefer no sequels in this franchise, but if we need sequels then this is definitely a welcome one. 
From the very beginning hockey game showing how all the emotions work together to get Riley through this game, I already got emotional somehow. Films like this are why I love film. I don’t relate to Oscar bait because they don’t seem like they are truly trying to bring happiness and entertainment to audiences. Films like this one are so high energy and well thought out to bring all the right stimulus out of audiences. 

I was very happy with this film’s portrayal of the teenage years. Every coming-of-age film has an obligatory need to include a romance subplot. So I was glad that this film went a smarter direction. It focused on a story involving old friends vs. new friends, and following your passions vs. controlling stresses. These are aspects that all adults have experienced, and they were communicated well to kids who will soon experience it themselves. This all then culminated into tear jerking moments in the third act that were very well earned and would be a good message to children. 

My main flaw is that I didn’t like that Riley was portrayed as a straight A student through it all. The first film worked well because Riley was relatable with all her struggles through childhood. She had relatable teenage struggles here too (as mentioned earlier), but further showing imperfections could’ve been a more relatable character to us. 

Another nitpick was the inclusion of many more emotions. It was a risk to double the number of emotions, and that too have them be named with niche words. Five emotions in the first film made it easy to track why each emotion reacts the way they do in certain situations. Doubling the emotions here made it much more difficult to track that, and I’m pretty sure there were cases where they acted incorrectly to their emotion. 

I think this was the first kids film I watched in theaters after the pandemic. That felt really nostalgic, I was in a theater full of kids and families. While noisy during the trailers, everyone was a proper movie watcher through the film. I’m happy I could experience the film that way. 

I’m also so happy that this film is doing very well at the box office. When good quality films are also box office hits, we can feel confident that the movie theater experience will be here to stay.

Now that this is officially a franchise, I welcome more additions capturing subsequent chapters of Riley’s life. I have no idea how they can stay family-friendly, but I’d fully trust Pixar to surprise me there.",,2024-06-18
2024-06-23,Memory,2022,https://boxd.it/6JiFkb,1.5,,"A good idea, executed in an inconsistent and boring manner. 

I love the idea of an assassin with early dementia. Even cooler to think the guy that Martin Campbell, the guy that directed the best James Bond movies, would be on this project. 
Sure, we already saw an iconic film of a killer with anterograde amnesia in <i>Memento</i> (which also has Guy Pearce, what a weird parallel), but this concept was still different enough. 

Unfortunately, nothing was executed well. 

The worst part for me was that for the first act, there are many seemingly unrelated scenes with new characters every time. I’m sure the goal was to bring mystery, but it more like terrible editing choices. 

The dementia was utilized incredibly conveniently, to the point where I sometimes forgot he had dementia when going through normal scenes. 

I’ll give points to the unique concept on a typical action thriller, because it gave me some curiosity on how things would end. But I was ultimately disappointed through the whole runtime. 

I know Liam Neeson is known now for high-quantity, low-quality wannabe <i>Taken</i> films. First off, I don’t know this model is profitable in any way. Secondly, I’m further disappointed after seeing what he was so capable of in <i>Schindler’s List</i>. I want that Liam Neeson back.",,2024-06-22
2024-06-24,Animal House,1978,https://boxd.it/6JPhYH,1,,"It seems like this film was a cult classic. I don’t see how anything about this was enjoyable. 

I understand that comedy films that work are usually “of the times”, as it’s very rare to get a timeless comedy classic like <i>Planes, Trains, and Automobiles</i> or <i>Home Alone</i>. Maybe I’d rate this film higher if I saw it at the time. But I still don’t see myself giving it a positive review. 

The main problem was that I couldn’t even be on the same side as our protagonists. They were sleazy, disgusting, immature brats with really no good qualities. I don’t understand why any of the women hung out with those boys. I can’t root for people that lie about knowing a friend that died, just to try to hook up with girls. 

I really didn’t get anything about the parade chaos in the third act. It seemed like a completely different movie, with low brow slapstick humor. 

There were some fraternity-related scenes (e.g. hazing, rush) that I found a bit funny. But other than that, nothing about this experience was enjoyable for me. 

I watched this movie in chunks. I saw the first thirty minutes on one day, and then the next day received the news that Donald Sutherland passed away. Felt surreal, because I was just thinking as I was watching him that he has a huge filmography with variety.

2024-06-26,Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2024,https://boxd.it/6Kz4O7,4,,"Another unique experience in the world of <i>Mad Max</i>!

I remember seeing <i>Fury Road</i> after all the hype in 2015. I definitely enjoyed it, but at the time I really didn’t understand why there was so much hype around it. Great visuals, but with a plot so simple I didn’t think this could be placed amongst the greatest action films of all time. 
Recently once I began watching the prior <i>Mad Max</i> films (particularly after watching <i>Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior</i>), I retroactively really fell in love with <i>Fury Road </i>and the world of <i>Mad Max</i>. All these films being vignettes of the adventures of Max in a post-apocalyptic desert world has such a charm. Despite being low in plot and depth, I understood the differentiator they have with low dialogue and focus on contraptions as set pieces racing through deserts. 
So with all this in mind, I had excitement for this film and wanted to support it in the theater. 

I had some concern in that this film seemed to be very closely associated with <i>Fury Road</i>, with the same characters and set pieces from that film. This would be a first in the franchise. 
My favorite part about this film is that despite the strong correlations with <i>Fury Road</i>, this film still took risks to be very different from the rest of the franchise. This one was true to the caption of “Saga” in that it spanned multiple years, unlike other films in the franchise that were just a couple days max in timeframe. This change in timeframe added an epic nature to the revenge plot. 

Anya-Taylor Joy and Alyla Browne as Furiosa was perfect casting. I genuinely didn’t even think about this character being cast by three different people through the franchise, because this all just seemed like the same personality portrayed through the films. 
The standout for me was Chris Hemsworth. This man deserves way more attention than many other Hollywood actors, he’s taking many risks and having great range across his performances. He was totally believable as a villain to Furiosa’s character. Given that the whole film rests on a revenge plot against this character, its execution is imperative and Chris Hemsworth did it so well. 

Every action set piece was praiseworthy. Truly, they were scenes that would never exist in any other film. The combination of contraptions, huge cars, raw physical brute, and desert vibes are all awesome to watch. 

My criticisms lie in the pacing and runtime. Prior films in the franchise had nonstop action. While they were short films, the short runtime was the right choice for films that aren’t plot heavy.
As stated earlier, I loved that this film is unique from the franchise in that the timeframe spans much longer length. But, given that the plot is still relatively simple, there wasn’t really much need to have the runtime be so long. Cutting some of the slower and grounded scenes would’ve worked better for me. 

I wish this film performed much better in the box office. They probably could’ve been more reasonable with their budget, but this film isn’t as improperly handled budget-wise compared to many other films. 
Also, a complaint shared all the time is that there aren’t much female-driven big budget adventure in theaters. We got it here, and it wasn’t supported for some reason. We need to support more films like this if we really want more of it to be consumed.",,2024-06-25
2024-07-01,The Godfather,1972,https://boxd.it/6MlSPf,2.5,,"My review of this will definitely shame me amongst cinephiles…

Before this, the only classic mobster movie I’ve seen is <i>Goodfellas</i>, which I really don’t remember much (also an opinion that will shame me amongst cinephiles). I think watching this film and my opinion of it just solidifies that mobster movies aren’t my cup of tea. 

I can definitely give credit to this film for having strong filmmaking aspects. At the end of the day was a very believable underdog story in Al Pacino’s character. I could believe other stories like Marvel’s <i>Daredevil</i> being inspired by the role of the Godfather, with a family-first image juxtaposed with a behind-the-scenes criminal activity. Despite being hailed as a classic film, I had genuinely no idea where the film was going plot-wise. 

The long runtime and slow pace ultimately made me not enjoy the journey of this movie. There was a lot of me waiting for things to happen. 

Usually after watching films, I do thorough research on films before writing reviews. I make sure the research doesn’t alter my opinion on the film, but I do this to make sure I have all the context (e.g. the background behind the story creation, why the filmmakers or studio execs wanted to make this project, what other reviews mention call out, etc.). Here, I somehow didn’t care enough about following all the themes or hidden gems or genius behind certain scenes. The little that I did see didn’t seem interesting to me (e.g. oranges displayed before every death).",,2024-06-30
2024-07-01,A Quiet Place: Day One,2024,https://boxd.it/6MsEwn,4.5,,"I love the world of this film, I’m convinced I’ll love every story in this world. 

Horror is not at all my genre, I typically rate those films lower than other people would. This franchise, however, is the opposite for me - I rate them higher than other people would. I think this is because the world is executed so well. The concept of creatures following sound is oddly very relatable in that as audiences watch the film, they naturally try to be super quiet as if they were also in that world. This concept is what makes the adrenaline rush of this film so much more preferable to me than other horror concepts. 
In addition, the films in the franchise have main characters that realistic decisions. Most horror films always have that one stupid person that does something stupid and immediately takes me out of the film. 
This franchise seems to also know that it shouldn’t try to answer every question about the world. Exploring where the creatures come from or what their motivations are would simply ruin the film. The franchise knows that the charm is to see how the people survive through it all, not to answer questions about the characters. Despite this film technically being a prequel, I’m glad it didn’t fall into those prequel tropes (unlike <i>Solo: A Star Wars Story</i>) and just told another story that happened in this world. I was worried it would fall into this trope with the caption “Day One”, but thankfully it didn’t. 

Huge kudos to the marketing department for not revealing details about our main characters. There was character information in literally the first few minutes of this film that were huge with character motivations, and none of that was revealed in the trailers. This character information was so uniquely risky for a disaster film and it was executed very well. 
A minor point, but I don’t think I would’ve titled this with the caption <i>“</i>Day One”. It’s true in that it took place at the beginning of the disaster, but it does allude audiences to think we’re getting an explanation for what’s going on, when that’s not really what the film is about. 

I was fully onboard with the two character leads here. We obtained just enough information about them to understand why they behave the way they do, but at the same time didn’t focus too much on further backstory. I enjoyed going on the journey with these characters. And without spoiling anything, I’m glad that the relationship between them was not a love relationship - we see too many of those in disaster movies and it doesn’t work well. 
The cat is also one of the best cat actors I’ve ever seen, and surprisingly didn’t lose any believability for me. 

The main nitpick for me is that the setting of New York City at the beginning of the disaster didn’t work perfectly for me. I would expect many more people confused with the situation, and a lot more noisy variables at play. There wasn’t much of people testing out how to get out of the situation, or random metro sounds going off. The people and the setting behaved as if we were many days into the disaster, once people have figured out what they need to do. 

All in all, another solid film in this franchise. I hope more films in this franchise keep what they have best: no explained world-building.",,2024-06-30
2024-07-02,Wish,2023,https://boxd.it/6MTPf7,3,,"A good harmless animation that got way more hate than it should’ve. 

I was excited to watch this one, mainly because of the unique animation style seen in the trailers. For the first time in many years, Disney Animation deviated their animation style. One could say this is another example of a studio imitating what <i>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</i> influenced. But, this had a nice Disney touch to it. I viewed it as imitating reading a storybook. I overall thought this animation style was a great choice to do for this story. 
I was also looking forward to the classic Disney setting with fairytale and classic vibes. 

Overall, this was a very enjoyable watch. I’m sure kids will rightfully enjoy this too. The world of wishes existing in spheres is a charming idea. 

I don’t really see myself rewatching this film. Not all the jokes land. The songs aren’t bad, but they are oddly exposition heavy and wordy. I didn’t have strongly emotional feelings as I left the film. 

I genuinely don’t understand why this film received so much hate from critics. I think this happened because critics wanted to fit a narrative of Disney failing in 2023. Most of the Disney films were box office bombs, and most of them were disliked by critics and audiences. So, it would be easy to say that this film continued the array of Disney duds. 
I could understand hate for films like <i>Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania </i>and <i>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny </i>because they were not only mediocre but also arguably tarnished the worlds of their franchises. I could understand hate for <i>Strange World </i>where the film seemingly focused more on DEI than proper storytelling. But, this film is just a harmless kids film - why throw so much hate towards it? 
I’m pretty disappointed with the critical remarks to this film that keep saying “this is disappointing as Disney’s 100 anniversary” or “this is not the level of quality as Disney’s classics”. Disney has made many classics, but it’s incredibly unfair to expect a classic from every Disney animated release. Not every Disney release is <i>The Lion King </i>or <i>Moana</i>. I don’t remember people throwing so much hate to normal Disney animations like <i>Bolt</i> or <i>Wreck-It Ralph 2</i>. So why are people hating on this film so much?",,2024-07-01
2024-07-03,What Lies Beneath,2000,https://boxd.it/6Nm0Xb,3,,"As much as I hate supernatural elements in films, I can’t help but appreciate this film. 

This has been on my list for a while because it involves Robert Zemeckis and Harrison Ford. More importantly, a fun fact I love is that this film was made in between the filmmaking of <i>Cast Away</i>, during the time when Tom Hanks changed his weight. It’s so wild to me that another film could just casually be made in that timeframe. 

I was very on board from the beginning of this film. It was set up with a unique contained premise of an older couple, played by A-listers. I genuinely don’t think A-listers would accept roles like this because they would view it as beneath them. I’m glad that Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford accepted this film, because they both really gave their all and it paid off. They played against-type very well. 

This film also contains some of the best camerawork I’ve seen in a film. Maybe the shots look extra cool here vs. a CGI fest because this is meant to be a contained film and not a giant disaster film. Either way, they were super nifty to watch. 

The film had huge twists and turns along the way, all executed well. New twists revealed smartly didn’t reject information that was shared earlier. 
The huge flaw for me was whenever any supernatural element was involved in the mystery. It immediately took my out of the film as I lost the believability.

The praises of this film are so good that I would ultimately recommend this film, but a version without supernatural elements would’ve been a perfect film in my eyes.",,2024-07-02
2024-07-03,Mean Girls,2024,https://boxd.it/6Nm1jr,2,,"Eh. 

I wanted to enjoy this movie. Unlike everyone else, I was open to a musical film version of <i>Mean Girls</i>, at least it would offer something different from the original. 

The biggest thing this film has working against it is that everything is just a worse version of the original. I would’ve been fine with different versions of each scene and plot point, but the versions we got just don’t have the impact of the original. It’s difficult to watch every scene without knowing that a better version existed in a film only 20 years prior. 

The difficult part with this film is that it is based on an iconic comedy. Comedies in particular are very hard to predict its cult status - it’s a combination of the right edginess and chaos at the right release time. The original nailed that 20 years ago. And the charm with that is there’s no way the filmmakers expected that - they just made something together and it just worked. 
This film, on the other hand, feels like it’s trying to manufacture its cult status. And it just doesn’t work that way. 

Every cast member gave the best they could. Definitely fun seeing Avantika in a major motion picture like this, I loved her in <i>Spin </i>- a very underrated Disney Channel original movie. 

Overall, given that it’s based on a great film, this can’t really become a bad film. But, there’s no point watching this when the great film does it all…greatly.",,2024-07-02

This has been on my watchlist since the beginning of college, when I was seeking out all raunchy and edgy comedies. While I haven’t been a big fan of <i>Family Guy</i>, I really enjoyed <i>Ted</i> and all of Seth MacFarlane’s Comedy Central Roasts. So I was excited for this film. 

I think the personal problem for me was that this film leaned heavily into the comedy style of <i>Family Guy</i>. The style of comedy is a lot of moments where the plot is stopped to draw out a random joke that is more low brow than you’d expect for the amount of time that is allotted for it. 
The only recurring joke that really worked for me was the fact that no one smiles in pictures. (I agree, I have no idea how everyone of every culture never did that back in the day!)

I didn’t necessarily feel like the watch was a waste of my time. Not all the humor made me laugh out loud, but it was enough to want to finish. The stacked cast is solid. But, there isn’t enough to recommend seeking out.

2024-07-05,The Internship,2013,https://boxd.it/6NXVl3,3,,"This has been on my watchlist for too long, ever since I learned that a lot of this film was filmed on Georgia Tech’s campus. This fact honestly brought me the most laughs, as I kept getting super excited when I pointed out which scenes were filmed there. Man, I would’ve been super excited to be in a vicinity of this if I happened to start college one year earlier. 

The silliness around middle-aged guys trying to understand the tech world was enough to make the runtime worth it. It’s true that a lot of these jokes required the plot to literally stop just to get the joke out, but the jokes were funny enough to not be upset by this. And yes, most of it doesn’t make sense, but it was funny enough to accept. 

I like the overall message of adults learning from young people, and vice versa. It actually did a good job of showing how diversity of thought and technical background is valuable in a team. 

One thing that I feel is so overused in cinema is how people start off as “nerdy” and then suddenly open up and find the meaning of life after a drunk night out. I don’t know why more people don’t shame on this trope. Here in particular, it felt really out of place.

2024-07-08,Kalki 2898-AD,2024,https://boxd.it/6Psucf,3.5,,"A film with great scope and world-building depth, but left wanting more. 

Many will naturally compare films like this to big-budget Hollywood equivalents and say that the Indian film industry is a worse and derivative version of said Hollywood equivalents. While I see where they are coming from, this film offers a lot to appreciate. 
This is based upon the Kalki avatar, and unlike other Pan-Indian films this one actually seems pretty faithful to the source material. I imagine many will leave this film wanting to read up further on the Kalki avatar. This alone makes me happy that such a film exists, and it is only appropriate to be created from the Indian film industry to provide a faithful look to the world. 

The best part for me is that the storyline was actually unique amongst other Indian films. Prabhas’s character technically had top-billing, but for the most part didn’t feel like the main character of the film. A large focus was on the characters played by Amitabh Bachchan and Deepika Padukone, both being characters with very unique depth. All this led to a plot that continued to be unpredictable in the best ways. 

My favorite character was Kyra - she was super badass. While normally I would wish characters like this had more runtime, here the shortened runtime actually had the perfect emotional impact for me. 
Praise to Amitabh Bachchan for still being such a commanding presence despite his age. This is a great showcase of his talent. 

Huge respect to Nag Ashwin for crafting the look of these worlds. Again, there can be comparisons to <i>Star Wars </i>and <i>Dune</i>, but the world overall still felt like it had its own signature that fit the story well. 

While the film had a very unique main story, subplots fell into typical Telugu masala movie tropes (e.g. a shoehorned love interest montage with Disha Patani’s character that really had no impact on anything, Brahmanandam’s typical odd comedy inclusion). These were definitely not as bad as other typical Telugu movies, but their inclusion felt heavy contrast to rest of the film with unique and epic scope. 
I wouldn’t recommend this film to people outside of the Indian film industry for this reason. I could be convinced otherwise if the sequel exceeds expectations. But overall, this was a great theater watch.",,2024-07-07
2024-07-11,Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio,2022,https://boxd.it/6QSYSL,2.5,,"I think this just solidifies that I am not a fan of stop-motion films. 

I have huge respect to the filmmakers of stop-motion animation. It requires a huge manual effort of dedication to compile it together. That being said, I don’t find the final product of the art as beautiful as traditional 2D or 3D animation. The visuals don’t feel as inviting to me. And that made the experience more like a chore than an enjoyment. 

Given that I saw the original <i>Pinocchio </i>somewhat recently, I distinctly remembered the original plot while watching this. The original actually didn’t have much depth and world-building, or reasons why characters were how they are. I appreciated how much was added here. There was runtime spent into why Geppeto created Pinocchio, and a whole World War I setting influencing character motivations. This was a very welcome addition to the plot - it enhanced the plot and impact, rather than feeling like unnecessary fluff. 

I know that Guillermo del Toro was very passionate about this project, and I was ready to share that passion. I appreciate the “darker” undertones incorporated, but overall I didn’t really feel the passion through the runtime.

2024-07-16,Alien: Covenant,2017,https://boxd.it/6TbhqF,3,,"Any Ridley Scott production is worth experiencing, this is no different. 

<i>Alien</i> is one of my favorite movies ever, it’s a contained space horror thriller that still holds up well. Admittedly I’m not as fascinated with the world as more xenomorph background is explored in the universe, as I do prefer the simple contained horror elements of the franchise. But hey, every franchise is milked these days, so what can you do. 

I was fully encapsulated at the beginning of this film. I loved the set design of the spaceship, the dilemma brought forth with the damage to the spaceship and its inhabitants, and the characters trying to figure out the dilemma. 
Oddly enough, the connections to the greater <i>Alien </i>franchise slowly turned me away from the film. I don’t necessarily hate the connections, but they don’t excite me much either. I think at least the original <i>Alien </i>franchise had great grip through following Ripley’s character. This prequel franchise seems to delve a lot more into origin stories, which I don’t think are interesting questions to answer. 
While looking up this film, I noticed that many short films were generated through the days, and maybe some of the short films in the franchise would make me appreciate the film more. But, I wish franchises like these could just stick to films rather than crossover with television shows or short films. 

The xenomorphs were the scariest in the franchise when you didn’t see much of them. As we see more of their CGI looks in modern films, they seem less creepy. 

Unfortunately, the horror elements felt very formulaic. Characters acted like idiots before their respective demises. The twist near the end was laughably obvious. 

Huge shoutout to Michael Fassbender for his strong acting performance. Also shoutout to Danny McBride - he wasn’t annoying, he had the perfect blend of seriousness while displaying his own personality within the character. 

Huge respect to Ridley Scott’s filmography. He’s made many films within the sci-fi genre (<i>Blade Runner</i>, <i>The Martian</i>), but this world still feels so different from the others. They are all so unique in that they don’t even feel like the same creative mind behind the scenes, in the best way possible.

This is the direction I wish other franchises can go. Not every film in a franchise needs to have high budget third act battles with setups for future aspects of the franchise. Everyone would be equally excited with simple plots that take place in the world of the franchise, but focus on making a gripping story. 

Personally, a good litmus test for a franchise film is to see if the film can hold well even without the elements of the franchise. This film passes the test very well. Despite a Predator character existing here, I was much more interested in how the human characters would progress through the plot. 
The film had the basic underdog story executed very well. Amber Midthunder’s Naru was really easy to root for. Being a woman made her an easy target for bullying amongst the other male warriors, but the film showed that she had the strong wit to overpower her enemies. 

A really good choice here was to set it amongst the 1700s Comanche tribe. We could see an environment and culture that I haven’t really seen in film before. A setting of no technology with a high-tech villain was also a great fit. No need to focus on world-building (e.g. why is the Predator trying to kill everyone?), the setting itself is enough to be invested.

Everything about this gave me warm fuzzies in my body. Films like these are why I love film. Not the Oscar bait or the high-budget stuff. It’s the simple fun for the whole family.

All the major plot points were predictable, but I still welled up as I was watching it all. What really worked well here was the characterization around the two main kids. Once a film can properly execute children to seem innocent and relatable (without honing in too much into annoyance), the rest fits together. 
Another great puzzle piece here was the contrast with Donald Glover’s character. We first see him as any other upset baseball team manager, so pairing him with the children was a great fit. It was hilarious seeing him try to stop cursing (and get other people to stop cursing) just because a kid told him to stop. 
The film very easily could’ve had a middle-aged person that eventually gets a love interest amidst all this. I’m so glad the film decided to go a different route and cast an older person with no romantic subplot so we could simply focus on the charm of the main plot. 

I’m mindblown by the cast of this film. So many people here that are child actors or very minor side characters that eventually became A-listers. Put this whole cast in a film today, that will easily draw a lot of eyes. 
Also fun to see the <i>Home Alone 2 </i>pigeon lady in another film!

I wish Disney could go back to making more live-action family fun like this. Of course their animated efforts are the ones that gave them iconic status, but live-action efforts like this are what also give them charm. It’s the type of film that they would never make today. Now, they would stay away from any sort of religious aspects (as minor as they could be) and focus on checking off checkboxes. Those type of decisions make be ok in the short term, but I question them keeping long term charm that films like this still have. 

My main criticism is that the film focused on heavily on the angels helping the team. I thought the angels would just be an initial motivational push that then translates into the whole team working properly cohesively together. But, the film doesn’t do that, and instead focused on silliness around the angels. 

I could share other nitpicks, such as how the silliness goes way too far and that there are plot inconsistencies. But, the charm from the leads and the underdog story was so strong that I didn’t care about these nitpicks.

The best part of the film is the concept. While many of the depictions in the film are inaccurate to what really happened to John Nash’s life, the depiction of the concept kept me interested through the runtime. The schizophrenia was depicted well in that I really wanted to root for him, but at the same time I understand why everyone around him felt uneasiness. It was also a pretty good storytelling technique in that as a viewer we question what is real and what is not. 

Scenes felt fairly drawn out and paced in a boring manner, which prevent me from raving about it further. 

I can understand why this film got Oscar buzz. I think ultimately this falls in the category of “good but not memorable”.

After seeing this film, I understand the charm. And I’d love to check out more in this property!

I didn’t expect that this film would have a sort of origin story for the turtles. I’m glad that was incorporated in this film to get me up to speed on the world. It didn’t feel like a waste of exposition time either, because it was cleverly incorporated with the villain of the film. Altogether there was a clear understanding of why our heroes became who they are, what the challenges the heroes have, why the villain did what he did, and why the heroes were the right ones to fight the villain. 

What made this film stand apart is the teenage aspect of the film. Amongst the four words in <i>TMNT</i>, I didn’t expect “teenage” to be the most fun aspect. These were teenagers in the most charming immature senses. They had such silly rapport together that it spread infectious joy. It was so easy to root for them for this reason. We didn’t get the annoying or conventional parts of teenage life, and I’m thankful for that. 

There are clear inspirations from the <i>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse </i>animation style. It fit very well here without feeling derivative. 

The voice cast here is so stacked, and everyone delivers well here. 

The film had joke overload for sure. One milking joke in particular was way too overused. Maybe about 80% of the jokes worked well for me, while the other 20% just came and went.

The best part of this film is how relatable the underdog element of this premise is. A tropical country like Jamaica participating in winter Olympic sports is absolutely wild. Derice and Yul not qualifying in the sprinting sport is totally unfair from any angle. The coach having a chance at a redemption arc is believable. The positivity from Derice is infectious. 
Anyone can watch this movie and share the feel-good moments. I’m sure Jamaicans in particular would be very happy watching this. 

What brings the film back for me are some odd editing choice. There are many moments where I could see a PG-13 version of this film was “supposed” to happen (e.g. calling a dude a “badass mother” makes no sense). The film also appears as if joining the Olympics is somewhat easy.

The concept of acting as a hitman to arrest people that hire hitmen is absolutely great. Even better with Glen Powell as a psychology professor that wants to try out acting as different personalities. 

I agreed with every single plot decision. Unfortunately, everything was executed in the most uninteresting manner. 
A lot of the film rested on Glen Powell’s voiceover comedically explaining his thought processes. It’s like the film wanted me to laugh out loud at all this, but it just didn’t have enough to be interesting. Compared to how Michael Fassbender’s voiceover in <i>The Killer </i>was enough to captivate a whole talking movie for me, this voiceover was very boring. 

The film also seemed to want to be a discount erotic film and focused way too much on provocative scenes between the main character and the love interest. The hitman part is way more fascinating, and it was frustrating that the film focused runtime on a romance with typical chemistry than the hitman dark comedy.

Glad to report that this still holds up well. I’ll remember to go back to this film anytime I want a simple disaster film. Every scene flowed through naturally. The group of storm chasers have enough crazy and chemistry to be a good popcorn flick, while providing the main characters with enough background to understand their motives. All efficiently presented so that we can just sit back and enjoy the visuals. No technically complicated subplots. 

What I didn’t remember until this rewatch is how prominent the sexual tension between the leads are. It made sense with how the male lead got captured into the disaster mess, but anytime the relationship conversations came up I just wanted it to stop. It’s not that they were bad (there were actually very funny lines) but it felt so out of place when said amongst life-or-death situations.

The best part of this film is how unpredictable this film is, even from the start. Everything about the premise was so risky, and it got pulled off effectively. The play on the horror premise was a lot of fun. 

This film is another example of how underrated Chris Hemsworth is. We seriously need to start treating this man as an A-lister. I never like the douchey jock character, but he was fun to watch. 

My flaws with the film is totally personal.

The Deadpool style humor continues to be hilarious in this iteration too. I’m still in shock that they were allowed to make many of those jokes. Despite this film having much higher budget and stakes than the prior Deadpool films, the charm of the Deadpool humor still elevates the watch. 

My fault is probably around the high stakes of the film. From the studio perspective, it is really hard to not make it huge stakes when you have access to Wolverine and all of the Marvel IP (and the genius marketing). But, it made the superhero trope aspects feel a lot more typical. For example, we got another forgettable supervillain and the motives are kinda shoehorned without fully cohesive connective tissue. Other than the Deadpool humor, this is a bit forgettable. 

I don’t see this film as turning the MCU around from where it is now. I don’t see it having the cult classic treatment like <i>Spider-Man: No Way Home</i> or the Avengers movies. This is more of a fun one time watch in the movie theater, and not need to see it again.",,2024-07-28

The concept is that an evil guy who hates recess makes a giant moon beam inside an elementary school, and kids try to thwart him. Yes, everything about that is ludicrous. But, it’s so fun and different that I just couldn’t help but appreciate it. I genuinely feel like anyone could watch this film and get a huge smile on their face. 

I’m glad the jokes still hold up well too. The comedic timing was actually really solid and unpredictable too. 

I admit a lot of my love for this is nostalgia for the 2000s TV cartoons. In a weird way, a 3D animated version of this probably wouldn’t slap as hard. 

A lot of the appreciation for this film really depends on your awareness of the television show. I admittedly forgot a lot about each character’s schtick, so I didn’t catch every reference. I kinda wish this film could’ve stood more on its own than have dependence on the television show.

Absolute bore-fest from start to finish. I didn’t care at all about any of the characters. I don’t understand how Rooney Mara and Cate Blanchett got Oscar nominations for these roles (nothing against the actors, but there didn’t seem much going on with their characters). 

What also really doesn’t sit well with me is a romance plot of an affair. I understand if the current spouse is absolutely terrible (e.g. domestic violence). When it’s “a couple arguments” or “don’t feel the spark anymore”, I just can’t support going through an affair. Especially when a child is involved.",,2024-07-30
2024-08-03,Titane,2021,https://boxd.it/71cgf1,1,,"Ew. 

I just don’t understand how films like this get awarded highly. Incorporating promiscuous themes in a film is already towing on lines, but going to this extreme is just disgusting. It’s not even art at that point. It leans into the most barbaric instincts of mankind that seriously need to get suppressed more by society. 

Even looking from a strict filmmaking perspective, things felt really wrong. 
Scenes went much longer than they needed to. I got the point of the scene after a few seconds, but the same gross repetition continued on for much longer. I can’t think of a good reason for this choice, as the length of the scenes didn’t add value. If it was purely for shock horror, that was accomplished in the first few seconds - the longer it went, the more annoying and grating it felt in my brain. 
The film begins with a focus on movie A, and then shifts to movie B at the second half. None of movie A was really resolved or incorporated into movie B. It felt like watching two different movies. 

The film follows characters that are very flawed. Yes, this is important for any film to buy into the plight of the characters and be invested in their journeys. And when done well (e.g. <i>Uncut Gems</i>, David Fincher’s <i>The Killer</i>, Martin Scorsese’s <i>The Wolf of Wall Street</i>), following a criminal as the main character is a fascinating subversion of expectations - there’s an odd adrenaline rush where you know they are wrong but you still root for them. But, this film doesn’t earn that well. The whole runtime, I kept telling myself that I hate what these characters are doing and that they need to be punished for their actions. And as the film kept allowing the characters to get away with it, I kept getting frustrated and not feeling that guilty adrenaline rush. The film tries to justify it by showing their emotional trauma, but I couldn’t buy it as a proper justification. 

The only reason I’m not giving this my worst grade is the lead performance. The role asks for a lot from her, from both a physical and an emotional perspective. No A-lister would dare to put themselves through this much disgusting pain just for a film. Kudos to Agatha Rouselle.",,2024-08-02

I watched this as a Ridley Scott fan and knew that it was acclaimed at the time of release. I was afraid that it may not be as fresh now versus at the time of release, given that we’ve seen so many medieval epics since. 

Now, I understand why this is the gold standard. 

What sets this film apart is that amidst the giant scope, it is overall a simple underdog story. Immediately, you are on the side of Maximus. Despite being super talented in that he wins army battles and is very strong, he actually comes off as just an everyday person that deserves praise. So when he has everything taken away from him, you want him to get his prestige back. 
This is all simple underdog formula aspects, but it was all executed well here. I think it particularly stood out for me because big budget films these days try to wear many hats and don’t just focus on doing one thing well. 

Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus was also a great villain for the hero and the plot. He didn’t come off as a silly mustache-twirling dude with an evil lair; similar to the hero, he came off as an everyday person that just makes unlikeable decisions. 

I had no idea that the score in this film is so similar to <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i>. I love it in that I told hyped up whenever I heard it, but I don’t know why Hans Zimmer let two iconic worlds that are so different have the same music. 

I never understood medieval scenes where people dying is a fun watch by rich people. This film made me understand the concept of that - all the arena fight scenes were so epic (to be clear, I don’t condone murder for fun - I just understand why Coliseum attendees would find it fun). 

So much praise for Ridley Scott. Unlike other major directors, none of his projects actually feel similar. Not only does he explore so many different genres, but they are directed so differently that you can’t even tell they are the same director. The unfortunate downside of this is that he doesn’t have the brand that people immediately recognize and grant him awards buzz. (I won’t immediately judge without watching <i>Traffic</i>, but I just don’t understand how this film doesn’t win the best director Oscar). 

I really hope the sequel is good. I am interested to check it out, but I worry that it won’t live up to this film. I also seriously can’t see a path to profitability with a budget over $250 million - how was that size of a budget even allowed?",,2024-08-03
2024-08-07,Twisters,2024,https://boxd.it/72XYwN,3,,"A time-pass disaster film.

This film made me realize the lack of recent disaster films from Hollywood. I think this genre is really welcome these days because it is big-budget thrills accessible for all audiences, and it doesn't require the homework of remembering what happened in prior installments in the universe. I hope Hollywood goes back to bringing big-budget films like this again.
I'm also glad we got a big-budget film that took place in middle America. Seeing so many films take place in the same big cities can get boring, so seeing a film in a completely different setting was pleasant.

That being said, I probably would've enjoyed this film a lot more if I didn't just watch the original <i>Twister </i>film. There are so many plot similarities between the two films that it felt derivative. If I didn't see the first film so recently, I wouldn't have remembered its details and feel the derivative similarities so much. 

Just like the first film, this film has a couple different things going on that don't fully mesh well together. This film explores the emotional heartbreaks that come from the tornadoes, but also has chaotic young adults chasing tornadoes for fun. I couldn't really understand how to shift between my emotional brain and my thrill brain along with what I was watching.
Also just like the first film, we're supposed to buy into the concept of multiple destructive tornadoes happening near the same location within days of each other. This may be typical, but it's still a hard concept to buy into.

Thankfully, this film didn't add so much romantic tension across the whole film. But, instead the film seemed to introduce a potential love triangle without actually committing to it. I didn't understand the purpose of this if it didn't really pay off.

I doubt I'll really remember much of this film down the road, but it had enough fresh aspects to recommend.",,2024-08-06

<i>SpongeBob SquarePants </i>is so near and dear to my heart. Anyone around my age knows that the 1999-2004 is peak SpongeBob quality. Despite the other reviews, I still very much enjoyed the two theatrical features that came out since the original - they weren’t peak quality but still had the nostalgic charm. 

Sadly, this film lost me. 

The first few minutes were actually great for me. I laughed out loud at most of the jokes - there were some fun Easter eggs to classic SpongeBob schticks that I fully appreciated. I actually liked the 3D animation style. I was fully on board with a film focused on the perspective from Sandy Cheeks, with SpongeBob as a side character - I was excited to see her backstory. 

Once SpongeBob and Sandy left the underwater, the film lost me. The live-action characters were atrociously unfunny. Sandy’s family was annoying. Even SpongeBob got close to annoying for me. The only praise I can think of is that humor wasn’t as grossly awkward as current episodic <i>SpongeBob SquarePants</i>, but it was still very unfunny and I just wanted it to end.

2024-08-13,Beverly Hills Cop II,1987,https://boxd.it/75zdz5,3,,"A fine time-pass.

I was curious about this film because this was a time when the film series was back to the forefront with <i>Axel F </i>coming out. Also, it was directed by Tony Scott which I was surprised by - I know him for many well executed action films, from <i>Top Gun </i>to <i>Unstoppable</i>. So for him to take a director role for a franchise that had more comedic vibes seemed interesting. 

I was invested from the beginning premise - Axel Foley's return to Beverly Hills had compelling motivation. 

Soon, I think it felt a bit more out of place. The Tony Scott action direction felt a bit at odds with the humor. Bits around Rosewood's recurring action star fascination and a cement mixer truck chase and a Playboy Mansion appearance really didn't work for me. 

That being said, there was enough chemistry amongst the leads and mystery to watch through the runtime. This isn't a chore to watch just to go to complete the franchise, but it's a good time-pass.

It’s frustrating because this film definitely still set up interesting hypotheticals. Should you try to save people that were somewhat involved in the killing of your son? But, this film focused way more on physical shock horror than on the psychological stresses. 

The odd editing choices annoyed me even more in this film. I don’t know why that decision was made. 

Seems like many of the films in this franchise were annually released at the same time of the year. Clearly the studio found a profitable hack with this franchise, so there isn’t much need to put more thought in the products of this franchise. I can’t really blame them.",,2024-08-13
2024-08-15,Luca,2021,https://boxd.it/76oNFZ,2.5,,"Nothing bad or offensive, but kinda forgettable. 

Pixar is typically known to have films with huge scope and world building - that’s what clearly sets them apart from other animation studios. This film was a very risky choice for Pixar in that these aspects are lessened. 
This may be due to a very short runtime, but a lot of background isn’t fully explained here. We don’t learn as much about each of the character motivations (e.g. why do they really want a Vespa?, why is Luca’s life miserable in the sea world?), which made it harder to wish everything works out perfectly for Luca. We don’t learn much about why humans hate sea creatures (and vice versa) so it’s harder to buy into the concept. Luca and Alberto fitting in with the humans was also odd - Luca begins with barely being able to walk and Alberto begins with huge fear of being with humans, but almost immediately they fit in with human movements. 
It’s unusual for me because I usually don’t care about this much consistency and explanation for everyday animations. But here, I think it was really necessary to flesh those out because there wasn’t much else to appreciate. The humor, stakes, and visuals were all fine but not extraordinary enough to rely on it for the film to gain enough appreciation. So the above nitpicks really add up and bring down the film for me. 
I think what Pixar was going for here was more of a “slice of life” approach rather than a huge adrenaline rush of stakes. On paper, that would be very refreshing for me. But, this execution felt more bland than I wish. 

I think another thing that disappointed me was that there was a lot of silliness without direct purpose. For example, there is a recurring joke with Luca’s parents trying to find their child amongst humans by splashing random people with water. It’s fun slapstick at a surface, but if you think about it too much it doesn’t make much sense (and they should’ve caught Luca much earlier than they did). Another silly aspect was that the whole competition was a triathlon of swimming, biking, and eating pasta. The pasta bit feels like it should just be a one-time joke, not a whole plot element. 

More nitpicky, but the setup of Alberto as a character was interesting. For most of the time I thought that he was being set up as friendly on the surface, but actually has malicious intentions with Luca. I felt this way because they don’t explain much about Alberto as a character at the beginning. Without spoiling anything, it doesn’t really go in this direction. 

Overall, definitely not a terrible film. It is competently made. The Italy vibe has charm. More background around motivations and less on the silliness would’ve made this a positive film for me.

Because I haven't had a close personal attachment to this franchise, I didn't have much to latch on here. The plot felt very hashed and unedited together. The jokes didn't land that well for me.

The main storyline was fine, but unfortunately very predictable. 

The storyline with Axel Foley's daughter was pretty frustrating. They had a negative relationship the whole time, and not in an enjoyable butting-heads chemistry manner. The daughter just came off as annoying, and brought forth an unnecessary and unflattering side of Axel Foley.

2024-08-22,Juno,2007,https://boxd.it/79HTmT,4,,"A refreshing take on a teenage pregnancy story.

The best part of the film is how maturely the pregnancy was handled through the course of the film. This is shown by the happy-go-lucky nature of Juno and the support of her parents, and her journey on finding the best life for her eventual child. Because the main characters acted maturely and had clear decision-making, it was an easy watch.
It was pretty heart-warming to see Juno's parents act supportive through this. It's clear that they didn't want to deal with a teenage pregnancy, but their support is a strong example of the proper way to deal with it.
I also liked the decision to steer away from sexual themes, despite being about a teenage pregnancy. I feel like most coming-of-age films would've leaned a lot more in this direction, but this film was smart enough to know where to focus.

The overall film also has a vibe that it is based on a young adult novel. It surprisingly is a wholly original film. It's pretty exciting that a film like this could be made at a certain time and still be a commercial hit. I'd love to see more movies like this come to the big screen and be successful.

A part of me felt that I had to lose some grasp on reality through the pregnancy. We don't really see pregnancy pains or mood swings from Juno. I assume this decision was made to focus more on Juno's objective independent decision making through the film. But, I think a further view in the struggles of pregnancy could've been interesting to see and add to the realism.

My biggest flaw is the direction of Jason Bateman's character in the film. I really didn't understand why this occurred, because it introduced unnecessary and unrealistic complication.

I felt no urge to figure out what is actually going on. The suspense was executed in a boring manner. The questionable events were way too weird for me to buy into them actually happening. In a way I’m thankful that I wasn’t invested because a lot of it ultimately wasn’t even explained. 

This felt a lot like a straight-to-Netflix vibe. Not all of these are terrible (e.g. <i>Society of the Snow</i>, <i>The Killer</i>), but most feel like content for contents sake and don’t go through the typical editing efforts.

It felt like random racial theme conversations were thrown in just because the Obamas produced this film. They really didn’t fit in well with this story.

I knew nothing going into this film, other than Shailene Woodley being sick and this film having some sort of popularity at its time. I expected it to be a time-pass romance that I forget about in a week. 
I enjoy watching romance movies here and there, but it’s nearly impossible to get to praiseworthy levels for me. What typically brings a romance down for me is that I don’t buy into the severity of the stakes. The characters feel like highly privileged brats that act like a relationship not working out will bring their entire life down. Also, the romances focus a lot on the sexual themes and not on the long-term joys. 

I say all this because this film managed to not only be a solid romance film but went above and beyond. The characters, premise, and screenplay all were crafted very well. 

The cancer premise is brought in immediately - we don’t experience the first diagnosis and the sadness afterwards. We begin at the acceptance phase, where the female lead and her parents are living normal lives with the cancer. This was a smart choice because the dry sarcastic humor made you hate that this family is being affected by the daughter’s cancer. 
While we don’t see the same amount of depth from the male lead’s sick life, we get enough to know how much it affects him and we hate that he has to deal with it. 

Every character feels like a real person saying real thoughts, and yet feels cinematic enough. I didn’t see them as characters, but as real people I know. 

With both leads being sick and yet clearly having great personalities, it makes you really want them to be together and love each other. The sickness provided the elevated severity of the stakes into the romance - they should get the most happiness that they can together before one of them randomly has a near-death episode in the emergency room. 

The plot was really smart too. I couldn’t predict how things would go, and the choices made all made sense. 

There were moments that surprisingly made me emotional. The main one was the Anne Frank scene - the internet seemed to really hate this scene. On paper, I would too - comparing a Holocaust experience to a teenage love story is odd. But somehow, the Anne Frank quotes in the background really resonated to the hardships that the leads were facing. 

I could nitpick this harder, specifically the fact that cancer patients would definitely look more frail and not as “attractive” as Shailene Woodley or Ansel Elgort. But, it hit all the right emotional beats. Definitely recommend a watch here.

I went into this film as a chore and not necessarily because I wanted to watch it. I’m not a fan of the monster genre and I dread unnecessarily long runtimes. But I needed to watch this as it was a critically acclaimed Scorsese film. I see no other reason to watch this film. 

I do acknowledge that this is a well made film. Top tier actors doing top tier acting. I could tell that every scene was crafted by a top tier filmmaker. Despite being a primarily dialogue film, it doesn’t drag as much as other dialogue heavy films. The runtime, however, really drags this out. 

At the time of release, the de-aging was strongly acclaimed. I agree it was well done, and if continued to be done this well, can open up many storytelling possibilities in film with the ability of casting the same actor across many ages. However, at the current time I have a fear of generative AI removing the need of talented actors. So maybe I don’t want more technological innovation here…

2024-09-08,CODA,2021,https://boxd.it/7hjwTT,4,,"A feel-good film with a nice incorporation of deaf people.

I went into this expecting a huge focus on the struggle of deaf people. I did not expect this to be a primarily coming-of-age film with deaf characters included. This isn't necessarily a positive or negative, just a glimpse into my expectations vs. what the film ended up being.

While not perfectly executed, I consider this an above average coming-of-age film. The main reason for this is that Ruby, the main high school character, had actual understandable struggles to go through. The struggles weren't the typical ""I want a boyfriend"" or anything else involving teenage angst. Her main struggles were around feeling held back on her growth due to always being the interpreter for the rest of her family. This is understandable because anyone of age would experience the same frustration, while at the same time still respect her family. She would also get bullied for having a deaf family, which understandably would frustrate anyone. 

Other than the natural deaf aspects, the first half was feeling like a normal coming-of-age film. Once the second half began, the film seemed to hone in closer on its goal and that's where it started shining for me. The emotional beats were fleshed out well. I understand the comparisons to the Disney Channel Original Movie formula, but I felt the tropes were all earned.

I'm glad with how the deaf family and American Sign Language was portrayed. They didn't come off with a lot of pity, but they were shown as a realistic family that accepted their deafness and still living normal lives. 

There were some aspects that I didn't like much. 
It didn't need a love story subplot - in fact, I think the inclusion of it made it worse in my opinion. For example, Ruby's introduction into choir was done to get with her crush. It would've made more sense for the overall theme if she found the choir hobby on her own. 
There were crude humor scenes included that were funny on the surface, but kind of distracted from the overall message in the film.

This one was on my watchlist because I adore Denzel Washington. Also, of all of Shakespeare’s plays, I am most ok with Macbeth. 

I didn’t expect this to basically be a very faithful adaptation of the play, even to including the exact Shakespeare dialogue. This seriously took me out of the film - every piece of dialogue felt so unnatural. I think it would feel less unnatural in a play setting, but a film setting with current medieval production design and direct Shakespeare dialogue was such an odd juxtaposition. 

I can appreciate the production design and cinematography. The choice of a more square aspect ratio and black-and-white looked cool.

I was bought in from the beginning of the film as we learn about Ryota's backstory. There is definite emotion there relate to through his tragedy.

The problem for me was that once the main part of the film began, I geniunely didn't care about the characters through the rest of the runtime. This made the runtime feel much longer than it actually was.

The film makes a choice to basically go through every point in a basketball game through the runtime, with some pauses from the game to provide flashbacks for each character. I wanted to appreciate this choice, but I couldn't. The scenes we see for each character weren't that interesting, and didn't really relate back to the main game.

It seems that other people loved the visuals of this film. Personally, I didn't think there was much to appreciate visually. 

Researching further on the manga, it seems like the manga had a different protagonist than what the film has.

It’s so interesting to me how comedic quips that downplay the severity of situations feel tired in MCU films but elevate group competition movies like this. I think it’s because the stakes of a high school competition are a bit trite for viewers, so even if we are invested in the competition we welcome humor that pokes fun at it. 

Amongst the silliness, I really liked the underdog feel from Kirsten Dunst’s Torrance. Her passion for cheerleading was admirable, and made all her decisions through the film believable. 

A few jokes were definitely cancelable on today’s terms, but I definitely wouldn’t dock the film over this. 

A couple tropes bring this film below perfect for me. First, the romance subplot wasn’t really necessary here - we could’ve just focused on the cheerleading more. Second, it wasn’t that believable that the Clovers had financial issues based on the setting of their scenes and their uniforms. 

I watched this movie on a plane. The plane was landing real soon and I still had a fair amount of runtime left, so I saw the last few scenes in 1.25x speed. Made it even more epic!

Overall, definitely a fun group movie to watch. I totally get how this got a cult following.",,2024-09-18
2024-09-25,Challengers,2024,https://boxd.it/7p0PIT,5,,"Easily one of the biggest film surprises I’ve experienced. 

I had no excitement going into this film. The other Luca Guadagnino film I’ve seen was <i>Call Me By Your Name</i>, which was critically loved by everyone else but I absolutely hated. I thought it had no energy and the premise was far from fascinating for me. So I was unphased by all the great press this film was getting, and I was extra turned off by the overly sexualized scenes in the trailers. 

I started watching this film on a United flight, and from the first frame I was instantly hooked. This was nothing like <i>Call Me By Your Name </i>at all!  The fast paced tennis scenes and even juicier drama was just great television. 

What I really didn’t expect to be so captivating was the relationships between the three leads. The last type of people I feel sympathy for are young adult brats that have everything but commit the stupidest decisions. Here, however, I was fully on the ride for it all. I think what really helped here was the nonlinear storytelling choice. We already know the current state that the characters are in, so seeing all of them in recurrent flashbacks in completely different settings brought intrigue to figure out how they got there. This brought very fascinating callbacks (especially one of those unexpectedly awesome Chekhov’s gun implementations ever). Following the relationships was pretty much a thrill itself. 

While the sports drama genre of this is not as much of the focus, my goodness they went so hard on these elements too. Never thought I’d say this, but I wish I saw this romantic sports drama in the biggest theater screen with the biggest crowd. Can’t imagine scripted tennis to be any more cinematic than this. 

Other reviews seemed to criticize the jarring scores, but I wasn’t put off by it. If anything, it matched the adrenaline rush I had as a viewer. 

This film actually feels perfect in its own way. Just like <i>Game of Thrones</i>, there are many reasons I should hate it on paper, but on screen it was so captivating and I can’t imagine changing anything about it. I also really praise films that are able to present something that doesn’t fit into a single genre. 

Poor Zendaya could’ve been a highlight from two films in 2023 (this and <i>Dune: Part Two</i>) and both of these got pushed to 2024 thanks to the strikes. Well, at least we eventually got to experience it and praise her!

Sidebar- I was watching this film through United flights where I had a layover. I finished the first half on the first flight, expecting to finish the second half on the next flight. To my surprise, the next flight didn’t offer this film even though it was also United! I’m not one to fully cancel an airline over one minor experience, but this got me real close. I had to wait two months for the film to come on Prime to watch the rest.

Side-sidebar - does Hollywood just need to make tennis movies starring Spider-Man love interests?",,2024-09-24

Amongst all the Apple Original Films, this one felt the most manufactured rather than creatively constructed. I wouldn’t be surprised if a lot of it was AI-generated. 

The film pretty much lost me from the premise. I couldn’t really buy the concept of a spy novelist unknowingly predicting undercover schemes. Once I couldn’t buy into the premise, it was hard to win me over amongst all the silliness and twists. 

There was such a huge star cast, and the big ones (especially Henry Cavill) were unforgivably underutilized. The set pieces felt like green screen sound stage cinematography. A bonkers scene in the third act was a fun watch, but there wasn’t enough buy-in to feel its ludicrousness at that point. 

I try to avoid comparing a film to the director’s other films, but comparatively this one was pretty messy and underutilized. Matthew Vaughn’s other films had more personality and “method to the madness”. The other films had ludicrous moments that were earned based on the setup of the situation and the type of genre the film should be. On the other hand, this film didn’t do that proper setup. 

That being said, this film is far from terrible. There are moments here and there to appreciate, and it isn’t offensive. Anyone can watch this harmlessly. But when you consider the amount of budget and talent at disposal, it’s surprising to see that this is all we got.",,2024-09-25
2024-09-28,Emancipation,2022,https://boxd.it/7qckXB,3.5,,"A gut-wrenching film through slavery, but felt like there was more potential here.

I didn't realize until now how many modern day films exist in a black-and-white format. Within that niche is still a wide variety of choices (e.g. <i>Schindler's List</i>, <i>The Lighthouse</i>, <i>The Tragedy of Macbeth</i>). The black-and-white in this film had a more desaturated grading to give a more earthy feel and emphasize the rough environment. I really appreciated this choice because it brought out the grim nature of the slave life. The budget is clearly seen on screen through its cinematography.

The film is based on the ""viral"" picture of the person whose back had many scars from whippings. This picture historically has been referred to as what showed people the disgusting nature of slavery. I think anyone would definitely be interested in learning this story. But, the film came off more as trying to fill in runtime with various scenes around this viral picture. For example, there are parts that show grossness of slave-owners, then there is a thriller aspect of the protagonist running away, then a brief sidebar after that thriller aspect. All of these parts felt like different genres that didn't cohesively connect perfectly together.
That being said, the thriller aspects were solid adrenaline rushes. The way any non-slave person behaved through these moments were disgusting, but properly added to the tension.

This film is definitely bent upon Will Smith's performance. He is great, and this showcases how strong of an actor he is. His character goes through hell, and I could believe it through his performance. 
Will Smith's character has a huge amount of hope and motivation, compared to other slaves in this film. I wish there was some background on how his personality formed in this way, to understand why he specifically had that trait.

I'm really appreciate Antoine Fuqua as a director - he's actually had a lot of variety in his filmography. It's clear that he put in a lot into this film.

It is unfortunate that this film will always be associated with the Chris Rock-Will Smith Oscar slap. I hope that the legacy of the film can soon be removed from that incident, because this is a worthy watch.",,2024-09-27
2024-09-29,Bend It Like Beckham,2002,https://boxd.it/7qzG8B,2.5,,"I definitely recall a lot of trailers for this film around the time of release, but I was also definitely not allowed to watch this film at the time. For that reason alone, I'm glad I can finally check off this film off my watchlist.

The film does a good job of rooting for Jess to pursue her soccer dreams. We clearly understand that she has the talent, but has many forces preventing her from doing so. Everything around the sports underdog story was fun for me. 
Some of the pushing forces did push the realm of believability. For example, being able to attend a sister's wedding at the same time as a soccer game is pretty unbelievable.

This film felt pretty dated watching now compared to the time of release. There's a huge focus on stereotypes of Indian households (e.g. pushing academic focus, gossiping Indian parents). I get that this was the differentiator for this film versus other sports films, but I don't think it was executed well enough to be understandable.

I also seriously didn't buy into the romance subplot between Jess and Joe. They had no chemistry, and really no major reason for them to think they were each others' better half. It seemed like this was included out of obligation and not due to enhancing the central sports story. I would've preferred this removed, and a focus on the friendship between her and Jules.

2024-09-29,The Shining,1980,https://boxd.it/7qRxQl,4.5,,"Finally checking off an iconic film off my watchlist!

I am one that is quick to discount acclaimed horror films, especially modern horror films. 

From the first scene, I knew I was getting into an iconic film. The tracking shots in the beginning are beautiful, even on today's standards. (It was also great to understand the shots from one of the cuts of <i>Blade Runner</i>.)

The beginning is also perfect at setting up the buildup of fear with the hotel location. It is immediately clear that the family shouldn't be here because things will go crazy. Somehow, I was more scared with this location than a token haunted mansion movie. It was so believable how this location makes Jack Torrance (and the rest of the family) go crazy. I geniunely don't know if I'll be able to watch another Jack Nicholson movie without remembering fears from this film.

Despite being an old film, everything was surprising plot-wise, yet made sense. I was at the edge of my seat the whole time, not knowing where the plot would go.

I really don't understand how this film was so misunderstood at the time of release. This film was even nominated for razzies. I don't understand how such horror performances and settings and cinematography could be treated this way, even from non-horror fans.

I personally would've loved it if the supernatural was more vague. There was a scene that seemed to confirm the supernatural, and I wish it could've committed more to the vagueness.",,2024-09-29
2024-10-02,Love Lies Bleeding,2024,https://boxd.it/7sc5xr,4,,"Wow, what a surprise of a film!

I know many gave good reviews to this, but I generally haven’t been positive on weird premises that appeal to the indie audiences. They generally come off as too promiscuous and artsy for my tastes. While this film has some of that, it all somehow works well. 

It was refreshing to see a unique premise all across the board. A film created in 2024 but set in 1989 in New Mexico. A bored gym attendant has her life turned around when a homeless bodybuilder shows up, then they fall in love, then both of them get involved in various messes. It’s not revolutionary, but it has enough to peak a unique interest. 

The chemistry between the leads is what worked the best here. While both are flawed people, both had very clear personalities and reasons that they need each other. This made it easy to understand why the characters made the decisions they did, even if an everyday person wouldn’t do that. 

What I really didn’t expect is how much the messes escalate through the film. The film did a great job of adding all sorts of wild twists and turns without losing credibility. This film was able to keep the adrenaline and tension growing through the runtime in this way. 

The runtime was surprisingly short. I appreciate this, but it’s possible that more runtime around character leads’ backgrounds could’ve benefited the film. 

In addition, some gross and promiscuous artsy imagery could’ve been avoided here. It wasn’t as distracting as most movies, but it was enough to prevent me from recommending to an everyday viewer.",,2024-10-01
2024-10-03,Wolfs,2024,https://boxd.it/7sEkJX,4.5,,"A whole lot of fun!

More than the inclusion of George Clooney and Brad Pitt, I was most excited about the next directorial feature from Jon Watts. He was the director for all the MCU Spider-Man movies. All three of those movies exceeded my expectations. They were also the movies that arguably had the most studio interference, especially considering it involved not one but two studios (Sony and Disney) and giant budgets. They even had the con of coming off as the third version of live-action Spider-Man and during the highly lauded <i>Spider-Verse</i> movies.  Yet, they all worked very well. 
All to say - I was very excited to see a Jon Watts film outside of heavy studio interference and IP. 

I was pleasantly surprised and thrilled with what I got. 

Again, this film had a lot going against it. This is a very different film from the Spider-Man movies, from both the genre and the rating of PG-13 vs. R. It also has a tired premise seen many times before, from actors that potentially could just be getting an easy paycheck with their involvement rather than actually putting full effort. Despite all that, the film worked very well. 

The premise of old A-listers butting heads comedically has been done many times before. When that usually happens, I wish that the film could focus on cool action rather than leads delivering silly quips. But here, I just kept wanting to see more of the leads butting heads. The chemistry between Clooney and Pitt was absolutely hilarious - they could just look at each other in a certain way and it would crack me up. The slow-paced dark comedic nature with old A-listers hating their life really glowed here. Who would’ve expected that?

I was also happy to report that the silly energy continued through the runtime. It didn’t just start strong but also finished strong. 

Also, huge kudos to Austin Abrams’s acting along Clooney and Pitt. This performance easily could’ve come off very annoying or awkward amongst talented leads, but I felt it came off very fun. 

It is perfectly paced at under two hours. More would’ve dragged it out too much. It didn’t have unnecessary subplots (e.g. romance) to deviate too much either. It stayed true to its simple premise. 

My one flaw is with two scenes having chase scenes that were unnecessarily elongated and deviated from the somewhat realistic nature of the setting. 

All in all, this is a hidden gem and I’m not sure why people didn’t like it.",,2024-10-02
2024-10-04,The Nightmare Before Christmas,1993,https://boxd.it/7t4Lgl,4,,"Ahh I can finally check this off my watchlist and into my watched list!

This film was admittedly only on my watchlist because it seemed iconic, and less because I wanted to watch it. The style of Tim Burton and Halloween spooky vibes aren't really what give me joy. I also wasn't intrigued from the look of the characters and setting.

Within a few seconds of runtime, I could tell my I was about to see something special. This may be the only stop-motion where I actually enjoyed the art. I'll go further - a traditional animation version of this wouldn't have fit as well. It complimented perfectly with the tinkery and half-creepy vibes of Halloween Town and its characters (e.g. Sally's limbs coming apart often).
Even all these years later, the visual effects were truly admirable. There was the right amount of imperfection, while also incorporating CGI well amongst the vibe. It totally makes sense that this was the first animated film to be Oscar nominated for Best Visual Effects (if only it wasn't nominated in the same year as <i>Jurassic Park</i>).
Apparently Tim Burton convinced Disney against doing a sequel with computer animation instead of stop-motion, and continuously avoids talks of more world-building. I totally agree - while there is a lot of opportunity to explore more (e.g. other holiday-themed worlds) and opportunity to make it quicker via computer animation, I would very much fear ruining the charm of the original. Huge respect to Tim Burton here.

The music and songs absolutely slapped. I will keep saying ""What's this? What's this?"" randomly and hope people around me understand the reference.

Despite having Christmas in its name, I was pretty surprised with how much Christmas was incorporated here. 

The third act went a bit too overboard for me. It didn't ruin the film, but I kept wishing we could go back to more Halloween Town explorations.
Oddly enough, I would've preferred this film to have less plot and more world-building and Halloween Town character exploration.

Definitely recommend this as a watch for anyone!",,2024-10-03
2024-10-05,Independence Day: Resurgence,2016,https://boxd.it/7tyAjX,3,,"I'm convinced that Roland Emmerich is my guilty pleasure. I am thoroughly entertained by many movies of his that are critically rotten (<i>Moonfall</i>, <i>The Day After Tomorrow</i>, <i>White House Down</i>, <i>Moonfall</i>, and now this film).

I went into this with low expectations, but I came out pleasantly entertained. 

I really appreciated the setup of this film as a sequel from the first film. The film starts with a very different Earth because humans reverse engineered the alien technology and constructed many hovercrafts and other cool technology. Somehow it felt very refreshing to see a film that starts with a ""futuristic"" vibe while having a past film as a reason for this creation.

I think Roland Emmerich really speaks my blockbuster language. As much as I respect Michael Bay and Christopher Nolan, they are too low brow and high brow, respectively, for my personal tastes. Roland Emmerich is just right for me. The backstories are fleshed out enough for me to be invested without losing credibility. The action sequences and visuals are prime popcorn binging material. I would totally be the annoying person that claps during the big moments in the theater.

I think what this film has working against it is the legacy of the first film. The first film had many iconic moments and iconic characters. There are a large number of subplots and their own characters. Thankfully the plot doesn't require you to understand everything here, but it was pretty unnecessary to include all of them. I definitely don't remember most of the characters that exist here.

I know close to nothing about the <i>Star Trek </i>universe, I’ve only seen the first two films from J.J. Abrams. And that too was a long time ago so I didn’t remember much from there. 
On one side, I feel like I could understand this movie without remembering much from the prior films. On the other hand, apparently this film had the most <i>Star Trek </i>fan service and callbacks compared to other properties in this franchise. Obviously all that went over my head. 

The setup of this film was intriguing. The shots of the entire starship being torn apart were wild - the stakes are clearly very dire with that much destruction happening in the beginning. I didn’t expect this much “loss of hope” as a setup, which immediately invested me. 

What followed subsequently wasn’t necessarily bad, but I think it failed to the premise. It went the direction of swashbuckling action and CGI set pieces and somewhat silliness. I feel like silly sci-fi fits a lot better with <i>Guardians of the Galaxy </i>than this franchise.

2024-10-20,Magnolia,1999,https://boxd.it/7AGEgn,4,,"An enjoyable watch despite the giant runtime.

This was on my watchlist purely as a chore - this film seemed to have a cult following in the awards seasons, and I haven't really fallen in love with Paul Thomas Anderson. The only person enjoyment I had to watch this was to see an acclaimed performance from Tom Cruise.

My favorite part of the film is how it is constructed as a mosaic of multiple characters in their own storylines with some of them having minor connections. They weren't all necessarily exciting, but they had enough interesting moments. All the characters had the right amount of imperfections to care about them. The storylines were all unique enough to feel variety through the runtime and stay invested. I also totally ate up all the moments where quick cuts happened between many different storylines, the tension buildup was strong. 

Viewing OG Tom Cruise films makes me kinda wish he can get back to dramatic roles rather than typecasting himself into high-budget action films. The performance here is very unlike what he is known for now, and he is a joy to watch any time he is on screen.

My main flaw is that I don't relate to the ""so what"" aspect of the film. There are aspects that don't make much sense, likely because they are biblical references that I didn't catch. To be fair, I enjoyed the journey of the film enough to the point that I didn't require the ""why"". But, it still would've been nice to relate to the film better.",,2024-10-19
2024-10-20,Kiss Kiss Bang Bang,2005,https://boxd.it/7AGECX,4.5,,"This movie is probably the movie that feels the most like improv to me.

The best part of this is easily the dialogue that all feels improvised. People say things that are hilarious, but also don't feel fully thought out and quipped. The punch lines almost feel like the characters accidentally got into their lines, rather than feeling written. 
The jokes also feel so unique compared to other typical comedies in Hollywood. They don't go for the easy raunchy humor. It really feels like improvised humor that can't be replicated by other films.
The best improvised nature of this is the unreliable narrator aspect around it. In one way, this gave the film an ""easy way out"" of plot holes, but I forgave it because of how silly things went.

I will probably like this movie more the second time I watch it. Whenever I see live-action violence and injuries and pain, it's hard for me to laugh at humor occurring at the same time as those films. When I watch this again later, I will probably be more prepared for the tone and be able to laugh at those moments better.

My one flaw is that it was a bit difficult to follow along plot-wise with everything. The nice part is that it isn't necessary to follow along so closely because the humor is the focus, but it would've been nice to follow the plot as well.",,2024-10-19

I was excited about supporting an original kids film. It looked like a film that I would've loved as a kid. It seemed to have the potential of being a cult classic. I was ready to support something so unique and taking so many risks.

Unfortunately, I think it tries to be way too different for it's own good, and becomes a dud.

The plot is much more convoluted than it needed to be. I appreciate something that isn't a mainstream plot, but it brought forth so many questions unanswered for too long that I quickly lost interest to see where the plot went. If I lost attention, kids obviously would too.
The plot should've just stayed with the concept of assigning appropriate imaginary friends to kids in need. That has enough of a unique concept to drive at least an average kids movie.

Despite the talent of John Krasinski and Ryan Reynolds, the humor also felt very average. I chuckled a couple times, but overall didn't have any memorable laughs.

The animation definitely looked unique, but again I'm confused with what it was supposed to cater for. It's not as visually appealing as other kids films, and not charming enough to win over adults. The animation quality didn't match the huge budget it had.

Here is me continuing to chug through the Apple TV+ watchlist while I am still in my free trial period. I'm glad I chose to watch this one because it's actually good!

I had no idea that the origin story of Tetris involved the Soviet Union, and I continued to be pleasantly thrilled as the runtime continued. I looked up the real story afterwards, and while the film definitely embellished moments a lot of the story is true. Who would ever expect an 8-bit video game to involve international politics during the Cold War?
It reminds me of <i>Argo </i>in many ways.

This was a nice perspective of how a communist country like the Soviet Union really prevents innovation. Makes you feel thankful for what countries like the United States can offer.

The film did go through a lot of the conventional biopic tropes (which does prevent me from raving about this further), but everything was thoroughly compelling. Taron Egerton's performance had the right underdog appeal to want to root for him, even when he goes all-in on risky business decisions.

I watched this on a plane that had subpar audio. I chose this film amongst other possibilities because I preferred watching those other movies with better audio. I had very low expectations for this film, I decided to watch it as a chore because it was an Oscar nominated animation. I knew nothing else about the film.
Immediately, I was so thankful that I chose to watch this film. I had no idea it was a silent film, so that worked out well to watch it with subpar audio.

From the first scene, I was immediately hooked. I connected immediately with Dog's loneliness in a bustling urban city, with the way he looked through his apartment window and heated his microwave dinner. I feel like the mainstream movie would've made a character with this opening then delve into sexual fantasies, so I'm so happy that this film chose to go a much more mature direction. 
Every subsequent scene continued to make me feel more intrigued. I continued to feel joy and sadness back and forth through the runtime. 

The type of emotions that this film makes you feel is fascinating, given that it is a silent 2D animation, which is not as visually attractive amongst the over-stimulation in the current world. In a way, I think this simplicity worked in it's benefit because of how universal and personal these emotions are. 
What I further appreciated was that the emotions were beyond what the typical animation would do. Disney has that formula down with their animated classics - while everyone loves these feels, everyone also agrees that they all do follow a similar formula. On the other hand, this film delves deep into companionship in a unique manner for the art form that sets it apart.

It is worth questioning why the choice was made to have a world similar to <i>Bojack Horseman</i>, with animals living like humans amongst humans. My interpretation is that using animals allowed the film (and the comic it is based on) more attractive for audiences to check it out, as just humans wouldn't have had as much appeal. In addition, a human falling in love with a robot may be interpreted in a much creepier manner than an animal falling in love with a robot. Either way, I don't really care too much reasoning further because I connected very well with the product.

I will forever remember this film when I suddenly hear the song ""Suddenly"" out in the wild. Sidebar: That is my music knowledge - I only know songs when associated with movies (e.g. ""Steal the Show"" by Luv from <i>Elemental</i>, ""P.I.M.P."" by 50 Cent from <i>Anatomy of a Fall</i>). 

It's a pretty funny coincidence that this has very similar plot points to <i>Past Lives</i>, which I also surprisingly loved. I find it even funnier that the other posters for this movie have the animated characters in the same poses as the <i>Past Lives </i>poster. Despite how similar both movies are, I would still recommend watching both because they have very different feels that are worth experiencing.

It is imminent from this film that it is from a person that will go on to become a true visionary director. Anyone can make a road rage film with a low budget, but only Spielberg can make that appear like a truly cinematic experience. 

There are choices made in this film that were likely done on budgetary restrictions, but came off as smart filmmaking. Never showing the truck driver added that much more to the mystery of the terror and tension. The lack of dialogue focused the audience mind on the tension itself. Filming in the middle of nowhere adds fear that the main character could die with no one knowing. 
I love watching the first feature films of current visionaries, because it shows why they deserve their praise. Back when they didn’t have the resources of their current fame, they made do with what they were offered and still made something worth talking about in today’s standards. 

My only flaw is that I did feel some slight repetition after some of the runtime, but that is a nitpick.

I would say I was probably in the middle of these two feelings through the film. The plot and twists were a bit too silly and convoluted if you think about it too much. The jokes are a fun time-pass, but I've seen them implemented better in other films (e.g. <i>Kiss Kiss Bang Bang</i>). 

There are definitely cool effects and stunts thrown around here. It is paired with a couple fun movie reference jokes if you get them. A movie strongly made for people that love movies for the cinematic experiences.

This film was marketed as a stunt double rom-com. Ultimately I felt like there actually wasn't much rom-com here, I'm assuming that was elevated to try to cash in on the appeal of Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt.

I've only seen one other film from Sofia Coppola - <i>Lost in Translation</i>. I was pretty bored by that film (despite everyone else raving about it). I was still intrigued to check out more of her films, given that she does have a name for herself.

I felt nothing while watching it all.

It's pretty frustrating because the real story is simultaneously so ridiculous, silly, and fascinating at the same time. High schoolers mindlessly robbing celebrities on multiple occasions is so wild. They weren't even the smartest high schoolers, they were making many other stupid decisions like drunk driving but still got away with stuff that literal spies wouldn't. And that should be a very interesting story in itself.

However, the film chose to depict everything here as a repetitive slice-of-life. They go into a celebrity's house, hang out there for a bit, go home, look up who they could go to next, then go there, and rinse and repeat. There was no thrill, no clear depth on why the high schoolers did this, or even how the celebrities let it be so easy to rob from them. 

As entertaining as it always is to watch rich people suffer, I wanted the robbing to stop because I hated the high schoolers as characters. Nothing about them felt badass or redeemable, they just seemed bratty and privileged. I'm upset that they of all people got away with as much as they could. If they even had an ounce of smartness, I could at least have some respect for them for pulling it off.

At this point, I probably will sit out the rest of Sofia Coppola's career.",,2024-11-02
2024-11-09,Anora,2024,https://boxd.it/7Lnve9,4,,"What an unexpected surprise of a theatrical experience!

I added this film to my watchlist because it was a Palme d'Or winner, which means it would probably have strong awards attention. That being said, I've had mixed feelings with Palme d'Or winners (e.g. I hated <i>Titane </i>and <i>Triangle of Sadness</i>, but loved <i>Anatomy of a Fall</i>). The only other thing I knew about this film was that it was about a sex worker, which admittedly turned me off.

I'm glad that I knew almost nothing about this film going into it. Not only did I enjoy the journey, but I'm glad I watched it in a crowded theater. We all had the most genuine laughter that I haven't experienced in a while.

My favorite part of this film was the journey. I couldn't predict where the film was going, so I was swept in on where the film was taking me. The film did a good job of switching genres through the runtime - it would feel like a romance film, then a slapstick comedy film, then a thriller. This was all executed in a believable manner, rather that feeling like jarring shifts.
The comedy was very unexpected to me. These days, I'm used to movies having either kid-friendly humor or shoehorned superhero quips or raunchy humor. I yearn for more films where comedy can feel unique (e.g.  <i>Home Alone</i>, <i>Planes, Trains, and Automobiles</i>, <i>Kiss Kiss Bang Bang</i>). I can understand some people criticising the humor as being too slapstick and too overdone, but I found it to be very refreshing.

Mikey Madison is undoubtedly a breakout star from this film. Her performance kinda reminded me of how committed Emma Stone was in <i>Poor Things</i>. Mikey's Anora had very interesting depth that most people wouldn't expect from a stripper/sex worker. On one side you feel bad that she is objectified and how this would affect her mentally, but you are also impressed with how well she plays the game to get the most profits. She also had perfect comedic timing with her physicialities and sarcastic delivery.

While I really enjoyed this film and recommend everyone else watch it with a crowd, I don't really think it deserves much awards attention (other than for Mikey Madison's performance). It was a fun journey, but I question if there really is a further meaning here (other than maybe some commentary around how sex workers end up into damaged romantic futures). I wouldn't be surprised if people down the road view this film as overrated. I'm glad I was able to experience it early on in theaters to not feel that way though.",,2024-11-08
2024-11-10,The Thing,1982,https://boxd.it/7LDCA9,4.5,,"I'm now convinced that I actually like horror…as long as it is not modern.

The horror movies that work for me (e.g. <i>The Shining</i>, <i>Alien</i>, and now this film) are ones that take itself seriously, avoid reliance on CGI, and set up an actual scary situation. This film accomplishes all of those aspects with flying colors. 

The setup is so simple - what if alien forms spread around like a virus but no one knew who was infected? A modern version of this would've involved overly beautified teenagers with unnecessary gossip drama and unfunny quips. But, there are many details of this film that make it stand out so well. The Antarctica setting adds a confined and chilling fear. Seeing all these masculine adults become stressed out and exhausted and paranoid through the situation was tiring to watch, in the best way. It felt like a movie realization of the video game <i>Among Us</i>.
The film apparently went very far lengths in the realism. They chilled the set so that the actors were actually very cold through the runtime. They didn't reveal who was the Thing, to make each actor feel very distrustful of each other. This made the entire situation feel so stressful to watch, in the best way.

Along with the behind-the-scenes filmmaking, the film feels like something that could actually happen (despite an extraterrestrial setup). Everyone acted in believably crazy manners due to the isolationism and the fear of the Thing. People had to be strapped with their limited resources and make the best out of them; it never felt like anyone had plot armor. As a viewer, we even doubt the alleged protagonist in the film.

It was such a good idea to utilize practical effects for the thing. No other film has any visuals like what this has to offer. No level of CGI or computer animation could match how this felt. 

My only criticism is that sometimes it was difficult for me to keep track of each person and their personalities and where they were in specific situations. It is possible that this would be easier for me to track when I rewatch the film, but for now this thought did go through my head.

I'm pretty baffled with how much this film was criticized at the time of release. I don't understand how release timing could detract a film as strong as what happened here. I love <i>E.T.</i>, but this is completely different from <i>E.T. </i>The last thing I would describe this as is boring or junk or unoriginal. It is also disturbing that John Carpenter's next projects were in question due to the performance of this film.",,2024-11-09
2024-11-11,Trap,2024,https://boxd.it/7MBh1d,2,,"Similar feelings as other Shyamalan films - good concept, subpar execution. To me, the premise isn’t as fascinating as other films he has done. So, a subpar execution doesn’t frustrate me as much here. 

There were a couple moments of cool ideas on how the main character could navigate through a concert while he is wanted. Other moments definitely take a lot of liberties to buy into, but I will say that it didn’t take me out of the movie in the moment. Overall, the plot went forward in more believable directions than what I expected.

The third act took a fairly ridiculous direction that went into subpar horror movie tropes. Sticking the landing better definitely would’ve made me appreciate the movie more. 

It’s also obvious that this movie was made for Shyamalan to showcase music from his daughter. To be fair she isn’t a bad performer, but it is awkwardly obvious how much of a spotlight she is getting in the film, which doesn’t mesh well with how much time each scene should have. 

I thought the awkward Shyamalan dialogue wasn’t actually that prominent here, but there was still enough of it to beg the question of why better thought isn’t put into the dialogue.",,2024-11-10
2024-11-13,Glengarry Glen Ross,1992,https://boxd.it/7NwVC3,3,,"A unique corporate drama. 

My favorite part of the film is the concept. With a huge cast like Al Pacino and Ed Harris and Alan Arkin and John Lemmon, amongst many others, it seems that this film should be some sort of mobster movie. Or, an obvious throwaway movie where they are clearly just in it for the paycheck. Instead, it is a film where all these seasoned actors are scared out of their minds to sell or be cut. No over-the-top violence, just vocal rage. 

I learned after the fact that this film is based on a play. It makes sense in hindsight because the settings are fairly limited. However, the film didn’t seem hindered by lack of locations, because the personalities of all the characters were enough to be invested. 

I will say that i didn’t really feel the “so what?” aspect of the film. I was willing to stay in the journey to see where it goes, but it ended in a way that felt anticlimactic. 

I totally dug the music playing in the end credits. It felt like jazz, but I could be very wrong.",,2024-11-12
2024-11-16,The Instigators,2024,https://boxd.it/7OOwlL,2.5,,"Chugging through random Apple TV+ watches until I lose the free period of my subscription.

This is overall a fine time-pass action comedy. The acting was fine, the story was fine, the jokes were fine. Nothing felt like high stakes in the way that classic action films provide.

I expected more from a Doug Liman directed film. I don't love all of his movies, but the other movies I've seen seem like Doug Liman does care about his craft and stand out. This came off as a typical action flick that will get forgotten in a week. 

I think a large part is that Matt Damon and Casey Affleck probably went into this film for a paycheck, rather than feeling passionate about the project. They obviously do have natural star power and it's what helps us go through the runtime, but they seemed to deliver lines in an effortless manner rather than an engaging manner. They have chemistry, but it didn't come off in a fun manner - I needed something more, like what George Clooney and Brad Pitt provided in <i>Wolfs</i>.

Sidebar - It's so odd to me how many high budget movies with A-listers end up on streaming. I will never understand the revenue calculations from that, or how you can get many eyes watching it. I question the future of Apple Studios if this continues.",,2024-11-15
2024-11-17,The Union,2024,https://boxd.it/7PsHPR,1.5,,"A straight-to-streaming forgettable action movie.

Despite how much action budget is on screen, it still feels like another generic Netflix movie. I don't understand how movies like this are still able to get made - they are able to hire A-listers and have enough of an action budget despite a straight-for-streaming release. It feels like a movie that just brings together the required generic action movie tropes without much artistic push. For example, Mark Wahlberg's character is supposed to be a ""nobody"" that has no background in violence, but often times I'm pretty sure the film just forgot that so that they could make Mark Wahlberg look cool in certain moments.

A couple action scenes were cool enough to continue watching, but there was really nothing else to offer here. It was clearly a paycheck movie for the A-listers, some additional content for Netflix consumers, and nothing more.",,2024-11-16
2024-11-18,Hillbilly Elegy,2020,https://boxd.it/7Q5EiN,4,,"Here's another film where critic and audience review fall fully in line with their political ideologies and not on the craft of the film.

It really annoys me that this film can't be talked about without politics, because this film is actually very apolitical. It has a lot of the spotlight now because it is about someone that is soon to become Vice President, but the film actually has nothing to do with his political beliefs. The memoir it is based on was released in 2016, and the film was released in 2020. JD Vance didn't have any public political leanings until he became a senator in 2023. So there truly are no political takeaways intended in this film. There is no propaganda here.
Rant over, now onto the film itself.

My favorite part about this film is refreshing the setting of the film is. We rarely see small-town US vibes in films. There's a homely family nature to it, but the film is also not shy to show the difficulties. None of the characters are depicted in fully positive light, which makes them seem like realistic people.

Glenn Close got the Oscar nomination in this film, but I thought that Amy Adams was the true performance to acclaim here. Amy Adams disappeared into the character of JD Vance's mother. I fully understood the feelings of everyone around her, where they are so frustrated with her behaviors but also care about her enough to try to help her.

There is a lot to be inspired by in this film. The fact that JD had such a shitty upbringing but was still able to ultimately go to law school is commendable. It makes you feel that you really have no excuse to achieve your dreams.
That being said, it felt like a lot of important life events were cut out here. We just see his small-town poor upbringing, and then being in law school. We don't see anything about his military service, how he got into and afforded college, or how he got into and affored law school. It would've been nice to see how he was able to accomplish that stuff and see more of his growing character.

The film makes a decision of shifting back-and-forth between JD Vance's childhood and adulthood. I don't really know the point of this, I would've much preferred a chronological order. There weren't really moments where adult decisions were directly impacted by a childhood memory, so this served no purpose.",,2024-11-17
2024-11-22,Shattered Glass,2003,https://boxd.it/7RW3wt,3.5,,"An intriguing glimpse into a true story of a journalistic scandal in 1998.

I really liked how the scandal slowly unfolded through the runtime. You start with the sympathizing for the main character of Stephen Glass. But soon, you are playing as a detective in the story along with everyone else, and you can tell some details are off enough to question what is happening. 

What is also really praiseworthy is the acting and directing here. It didn't feel like actors acting. Everything felt like scenes that were actually occurring. No one looked overly polished; they appeared to have no makeup, people said normal lines of dialogue. I felt like a fly on the wall amongst real events.

There was a choice to make this film told as a flashback, with Stephen Glass speaking to a classroom. I thought this was an odd choice, considering how the ultimate ending turned out. Maybe it was valuable to get the audience on his side from the start, but there could've been a more consistent way to do that.

It's intriguing to watch this film in the current age, where media lies occur all the time without anywhere near as much accountability as what happened in this film.",,2024-11-21
2024-11-24,Hot Frosty,2024,https://boxd.it/7SYNlf,1.5,,"Weird.

This is probably the most click-baity movie title I've ever seen. Perfect for Netflix audiences that scroll through, you can't help but laugh at the title.

I'll admit that I too was intrigued by the premise - what if a snowman turns into a person? Unfortunately, nothing interesting is done with this. All the jokes around this man being a former snowman weren't that funny. The purpose through the runtime and the rules of the situation were really unclear, making it difficult to understand where the plot should go. For example, I couldn't buy that a former snowman would be the perfect wingman at a high school dance.

I'll give it some credit for proving some reliable Christmas spirit. If the Christmas part of this film didn't exist, it wouldn't have much to offer.",,2024-11-23
2024-11-26,The Whale,2022,https://boxd.it/7U86Kv,3,,"I'm surprised how much I didn't hate this film.

This has been on the watchlist for some time because I've wanted to support Brendan Fraser's acclaim. But, nothing about the premise looked attractive to me. It seemed like complete Oscar bait, and I historically haven't been a big fan of Darren Aronofsky.

What surprised me was how much I actually wanted to watch through the runtime. I actually cared to learn more about this guy's situation, why he got there, and how all the other characters are involved with him. And despite the entire film taking place in just this apartment, the mystery was still engrossing enough to watch through.

You also can't help but appreciate the prosthetic work that went into this. It makes you continuously disgusted with the situation, and understand how obseity is a negative feedback loop that gets worse when the emotional health gets worse too.

Brendan Fraser's performance is definitely praiseworthy, but I hold that Austin Butler deserved the Oscar more for <i>Elvis</i>.

There were many details that didn't work for me. The ending made absolutely no sense to me, and I don't care enough to interpret it. Once I learned more about Charlie's background, I just lost sympathy for his situation because he objectively put himself into that hole.",,2024-11-25
2024-11-27,Everest,2015,https://boxd.it/7Uzr61,5,,"What a chilling (no pun intended) true story about an Everest expedition!

I admittedly saw the third act of this movie before at some point on TV. That was seared into my brain, and I kept telling myself that I have to see that whole movie. The emotional weight and visuals of the ending was something I could never forget. Finally I can check this off my watchlist and get the context behind that ending.

I'm sure a lot of this film was sensationalized compared to the true story, but it did geniunely look like I was watching real events. The expedition formation all looked real, the base camps all looked real, the dangers of Everest all looked real. The use of moving ropes and rickety ladders across snowy Everest hills looked really scary. But at the same time, I could understand the perspectives of people wanting to keep going to claim the victory that they conquered Everest. In other words, I didn't feel like the characters were stupidly putting themselves into dangerous situations for the movie thrill. 

Without spoiling anything, there are things that went wrong in the true story and those are depicted here as well. In the least offensive way possible to the families affected by the tragedy - I like that the film didn't shy away from showing the wrong decisions that built up to this. Often times in film, the main characters are advised against doing certain actions but do them anyways, and there isn't much of a consequence. Here, there are clear consequences that occur. One of the messages beat into me during my paper mill internships was that every accident is preventable. No accident occurs out of the blue; an accident fails because someone messed up a process. I appreciate that this is one of the few films that keeps that truth valid.

The only slightly negative thing I can think of is that this film isn't as chilling as <i>Society of the Snow</i>, another true story of a devastating experience in a cold snowy climate. But if that film didn't exist, I would never view this film as ""second"" in anything.

I'm surprised this film isn't as known around, especially given the huge cast. It seems to have gotten it's budget back, but I think it definitely deserved more appreciation.",,2024-11-26
2024-11-28,Wicked,2024,https://boxd.it/7V0WjT,4,,"The rare moment when all the hype is justified.

I was worried going into this film, thinking I would be disappointed after how much hype built up from this film. But I left the theater with a huge smile on my face.

Without a doubt, the production design is the best part here. Apparently a lot of practical effects and sets were constructed for this film, and all that work definitely paid off. All the sets and costumes felt so intricate and colorful and beautiful and made everything so much more captivating than a typical film.

While I enjoy musicals in film, I haven't always been the biggest fan of Broadway adaptations into film. To me, Broadway is more for actors to showcase their vocal spotlights rather than be plot-driver. On the other hand, this adaptation is easily the best, if not one of the best. Nothing about the film actually felt like it was a Broadway adaptation, in the best ways. All the songs were great and fit the plot well. Scenes didn't feel like they took place in reused sets. 

The musical talent on screen is impeccable. Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo brought so much energy to their characters. They were cast perfectly as Galinda and Elphaba. I wouldn't go as far as awards worthy, but they were definitely solid. Apparently all the vocals were sung live while filming - there is so much to commend here. 

Huge kudos to John M. Chu for effectively adapting this Broadway show into a film that does it justice and brings new perspective into the property. I have been a fan of production design in prior works (e.g. <i>Crazy Rish Asians</i>, <i>In The Heights</i>), and it feels like that was all a stepping stone to get here.

My biggest criticism is with the plot itself. Despite the full on Oz theme, there was a large part that felt like a typical high school drama. It wasn't bad by any means, but just felt like a high-budget Disney Channel Original Movie. It got more interesting to me once more of the Oz lore was incorporated. The film seemed to be leaning towards exploring this more in the second film, so I expect I will enjoy that more.

This was my first drive-in theater experience. It definitely is interesting and the radio audio worked much better than I expected. It is a cool concept to just bring your own food and blankets and watch from your car. However, it felt weird to watch with other outside nature sounds going on. And turning my head to the side showed screenings of <i>Moana 2 </i>and <i>Gladiator II </i>and <i>Red One</i>. The biggest criticism I had with this experience, though, was that the lighting was not bright enough. This film looked really bright in the trailers, but did not translate to a drive-in screen. When there was writing on a paper, I had no idea what it said. Overall I wished I saw this film in a packed traditional movie theater to take in the experience better and feel the excitement from the other audience members. And I will still generally prefer traditional movie theaters over drive-in theaters.",,2024-11-27
2024-11-30,Last Christmas,2019,https://boxd.it/7VY2ND,1,,"Um…what?!?!

I remember back when there were many ads for this film. It seemed like a normal Christmas rom-com (which I love) but didn't feel the need to seek it out in theaters. Decided to watch this finally on streaming during the holiday season.

The film starts with Emilia Clarke's character being an absolute horrible human being. I think the film was trying to make the audience feel pity for her, but I felt the opposite way. That being said, once we see more from her backstory, I slowly started opening up and understanding that she could be a horrible person that deserves a second chance. 

Won't spoil the twists, but when they happened it made me just go ""…really?"". I pretty much gasped because it completely took me out of the film. I read up on reviews later, and apparently many people could guess this was the direction based on the marketing. I don't know how people could predict that because it was so out of left field.

I definitely wouldn't recommend watching this if you are looking for a typical Christmas rom-com. It's possible I'd be more positive on the film the second time I watch it, knowing where the plot eventually goes.

2024-12-01,Greenland,2020,https://boxd.it/7WC49b,3.5,,"An enjoyable disaster film.

This is a good example of how you can still bring world-ending thrills with a mid-budget. A run-of-the-mill franchise version of this would've focused a lot on CGI spectacle. Instead, this film brings in fear from the human interactions. 

For some reason, the inclusion of Gerard Butler made me want to think this movie would be campy. But it really is the opposite. He has a very good serious performance as a father, along with Morena Maccarin. I panicked along with them through the film. 

The setup was very believable, both the actual natural disaster and how a government would handle such a situation from the perspective of the US citizens.

There were some dumb decisions that made me turn my head a bit. I wouldn't say it took me out of the film because I'm sure its expected that random people will act stupid like this in disaster situations. But it did still make me notice it enough to mention it.

Ultimately this still feels mainstream in ways. That's not a bad thing, but it doesn't do much more to stand out (e.g. compared to <i>Civil War</i>).

I don't know why mainstream movies keep including divorced parents. The subplot of the husband and wife rekindling amongst a disaster is such a distraction. It would be much better to just assume they are married with a child and focus and getting all of them to safety. I'm guessing divorces are included for the purpose of relatability, but there are many other better ways to get that across.",,2024-11-30
2024-12-02,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,2017,https://boxd.it/7XeSM9,2,,"The only other Yorgos Lanthimos film I have seen is <i>Poor Things </i>- my overall view of that film was that I hated it's premise but loved how it looked and felt it deserved all the Oscars that it won. I usually don't judge a director until I've seen at least two of their films, so that I don't focus my preconceived notions on just one film that didn't sit with me right.

Unfortunately, I don't think this film won me over to seek out other films from Yorgos Lanthimos.

My favorite part of the film is definitely the premise. This is the type of horror I want more of - less of physical shock horror and more of mind-numbing horror. The setup was off-putting in all the right ways to make you fear for this family. The cinematography complimented the off-putting nature well to make you feel unsettled through the runtime. Films like this are proof that you don't need a high production budget to provide quality horror.

The direction it ended up going afterwards really lost me though. It doesn't follow the typical conventions of retroactively explaining why certain events happened, as that is not the focus. It was like the film wanted me to appreciate the art more than the logic, but I couldn't be won over. I ultimately left very unsatisfied, compared to the engrossing mystery that was set up from the premise.

There were many weird scenes out of the blue that had no place for this film. For example, the intimate scenes around the two leads were filmed in an absurd manner rather than a normal manner - I don't get the artisitic reason for doing it in this manner, because they just came off weird rather than commendable. 

I don't think the deadpan delivery worked for me here at all. It was more believable than M. Night Shyamalan's awkward dialogue, but still felt odd to me with the severity of the premise.

I can tell that an iconic part of the direction of Yorgos Lanthimos is the camera placement and panning. The way shots are filmed here were intriguing. This may be the main reason I'd seek out more films from him, rather than the content of the films.",,2024-12-01
2024-12-08,Finch,2021,https://boxd.it/7ZSpin,4.5,,"This binge through my free Apple TV+ subscription is really surprising me.

A lot of the marketing looked like this would be a forgettable sci-fi apocalypse flick that is imitating existing better versions of this movie. That being said, I was curious to check this out due to the existence of Tom Hanks and a director of Miguel Sapochnik (who directed my favorite Game of Thrones episodes).

What is admirable here is how personable the film feels through the runtime. Huge kudos to Tom Hanks for continuing to actually care in all his projects and not just take the paycheck. He has so much range and it is shown here. There can be many parallels to <i>Cast Away</i> but he still provides a different performance that fits this setting correctly. Being basically the only human in this film, a lot is required from Tom Hanks but he somehow naturally drives the story forward well. The connections with the humanoid robot were surprisingly emotional for me.

The setting of this post-apocalypse was also well done. The setting involves the sun's UV rays being dangerous and a ""road trip"" through large scope deserts. The large scope felt much more cinematic than typical streaming quality (e.g. <i>Bird Box</i>), which makes me really wish this had a theatrical release.

I would've appreciated more world-building here. This is definitely more of a character study film of Tom Hanks' character and relationship with the humanoid robot. But, the clear high budget from the surroundings made me feel like there was so much more to explore from the external environments. There was a fairly admirable choice to purposely avoid shots of other savage humans - I bet this was done to bring fear out of the unexpected. But, I don't think this was set up in the right way to feel enough fear out of the mystery. I needed more reasoning on why Tom Hanks was doing certain actions in a certain way so that I could root for them better.

All in all, I think anyone would enjoy this film's journey. It is definitely a hidden gem that I hope more people explore. If this film actually had a theatrical release instead of a streaming release, I'm confident it would've received more love.",,2024-12-07
2024-12-08,Fly Me to the Moon,2024,https://boxd.it/7ZWmhJ,4.5,,"A surprisngly fun thriller of a fake story during the moon landing!

I was shocked with how much I enjoyed this film. All I heard about this film was that it was an over budget Apple Original rom-com. So this was a heavily mismarketed film.

This has to be one of the best executions of a concept that seems ridiculous on paper. The obvious choice of a film in this time period is to recount the moon landing. But instead, what if we focused on a fake story about marketing the moon? Nothing about that concept should work, but it is pulled off very well here.
Normally I utterly despise films that take ""creative liberties"" to recount historical stories that didn't actually happen. But here, the execution of this story was so good that I didn't care. (Also, I have a weird fascination with believing that this story did actually happen, but the government is hiding it from us.)

I had mixed feelings with the introduction of Scarlett Johansson's character as a manipulative advertising exec. But as she continued on, I really grew to appreciate this character. She totally won me over on how advertising is so valuable to win people over.

I felt Channing Tatum was slightly miscast here, but I did really like his character and story. All of his behaviors were believable and understandable. I admittedly felt a bit emotional in the moments where we delved deeper into his backstory.

There were definitely many ludicrous moments (most especially trying to fool the FBI), but I forgave the film for it because they were all entertaining watches.

Apple seems to be losing the streaming wars due to its low quantity of content. I admit I have mixed reviews across their film library, but I will give them credit that they make the most cinematic films. Original content for other streaming services feel much more made-for-home. This film would've been a solid theater watch.

As for flaws, it could've leaned less into the romatic subplot. It takes much less of a spotlight than what the marketing claims, but I found it to be a distraction amongst the more interesting plot points.

2024-12-09,Blitz,2024,https://boxd.it/80awiP,3.5,,"A fairly gripping slice of life thriller with a World War II backdrop.

I watched this because it seemed to generate some potential awards buzz and I was getting dangerously close to the end of my Apple TV+ subscription. 

I like the concept of a kid's journey and a mother's fear through the havoc of World War II. We get to see the impact of war on everyday people, rather than the political or army details. The performances are done well by Elliott Heffernan and Saoirse Ronan. I hope Elliott Heffernan gets offered more projects after seeing his talent here.

The visuals here felt very cinematic and jarring (as expected from an Apple Original Film). The shots of burning buildings and civilians trying to find shelter were gripping to watch. In particular, the scene of a metro station flooding was wild to watch.

The execution of the concept felt a bit messy. For example, it's not very clear why the child left a train ride to safety, and felt the urge to go through such a trecherous journey just to get back home. 

It is easy to call this film Oscar bait, because it is trying to push Saoirse Ronan and Steve McQueen into awards buzz. It ultimately seems to fail getting nominations, but I think its legacy will still be a worthy watch.",,2024-12-08

I see nothing positive about this movie and don’t understand why the awards are raving about it. Amongst the Mexican drug crime world, sex change operation, and musical numbers - this was just an overly dramatic Hallmark movie plot. 

The performances weren’t bad, but they just came off as people doing their acting jobs and not as acclaim worthy. 

It was darkly lit for most of the movie for some reason, making it all feel so cheaply made and uninteresting. 

And to top it off, I genuinely don’t understand the point of the musical incorporation. None of the songs were catchy. Normal conversations turned into song in the most awkward ways possible. A grim meeting between a drug lord and a kidnapped lawyer just turned laughable once a musical number hit.

I knew that this film had a cult following since it's release, which is why it has been on my watchlist for a while. I knew that it was very odd, but I admittedly was not prepared for how much weirdness this film brought in. I guess the best praise I can give this film is that I would be interested to check it out again in the future, even if I am put off by a lot of it now.

I get that this is supposed to be a satire, but I didn't find much of it that funny. The only funny parts were me were Christian Bale's narration about the randomest topics (e.g. morning routine, dinner reservations, business cards). 

I was pretty put off by many over-the-top scenes (e.g murders, people invited to Bateman's apartment). Again, I get that it is all satire, but it went too overboard for me to find enjoyment in it.

Without spoiling anything, the ending is intriguing.

Respect to this film for being memorable for the weirdest reasons. The content is really controversial and on paper should be unfilmable. Somehow, it was constructed in a way that is memorable enough for me and commendable from everyone else that watched this.

There are many films out there about the rise and fall of a drug trade empire. I would generally rate this film as above average compared to the bunch.

What really helped here was I was heavily invested in both Denzel Washington's character as the drug gangster and Russell Crowe's character as the detective. I wanted both of them to succeed, which is a testament to how gripiping both of their storylines were.

Denzel's ""My Man"" should be more iconic. It reminded me of the track music in the <i>Beverly Hills Cop </i>movies - overused, but I ate it up every time.

Surprisingly, the long runtime didn't bother me here. I don't think I would've cut anything and I didn't feel too bored.

After reading up the true story of this film, it is clear that creative liberties were taken. This normally would tick me off, but I didn't think anything was too off to warrant major offenses.

There were some crude scenes that didn't need to exist in my opinion, but admittedly they were much less than what the typical drug trade film would have.

2024-12-18,Gladiator II,2024,https://boxd.it/85866z,3,,"A passable sequel, but doesn't compare to the first film.

I didn't experience the first film through it's hype, I watched it relatively recently. I loved that film, mainly because despite it's heavy budget it was a simple and relatable underdog story executed well. I had hesitations on a sequel to this film, but I trusted Ridley Scott and the creative team.
Ultimately, I didn't hate the film, but it is admittedly forgettable. The main issue is that you can't watch this film without constantly comparing to the first film, especially given that it has the same director as the first.

I'm happy I experienced this film on the big screen because the set pieces are definitely admirable. When comparing to Ridley Scott's other films, I don't think they are his best though. I was blown away by the effects of the first film, and that was made on a much smaller budget. The fight scenes in this film are great, but the fight scenes in <i>Napoleon </i>were much more raw and exhilarating. I wish there was less reliance on CGI effects in this film (especially the baboon fight scene).

One aspect I liked about the first film was that it made me actually believe that watching people kill each other live in the Coliseum is actually super exciting. This film continued that sentiment, even if to a lesser extent. The one area this film excelled further was in the Coliseum fight that had water and sharks - that was wild.

I felt that everything else was strongly okay. Nothing too bad, but most aspects kept making me say ""the first film did it better"". Paul Mescal as a lead was strongly subpar compared to Russell Crowe in the first film. The plot was much more convoluted than it needed to be. It's a shorter runtime than the first film, but somehow feels longer. Everyone is raving about Denzel's performance, but I found it to be fairly normal (along with everyone else's performance). The score was fine, but it easily paled compared to what Hans Zimmer did in the first.

Further detail on the convoluted plot - there were many choices that felt messy. For example, someone that was set up as the main antagonist turned out to not be that. Someone that was set up as a mentor figure turned into something else, and not in a mindblowing twist way. This made it hard for me to figure out who to root for.

In general, this film doesn't tarnish the legacy of the first film. It does make me question if it downplayed the impact of Maximus from the first film, however.

Despite how mixed I feel about this film, I still have huge respect for Ridley Scott directing such a huge film even at 86 years old. Even if he isn't in his prime, I am still excited to see more of his content.

2024-12-20,Stree 2,2024,https://boxd.it/86fZdt,3,,"A horror comedy actually done well enough for me to like.

Almost every horror comedy from Hollywood is campy. They focus too much on the silly and put no effort into making a worthy story or characters. On the other hand, this film had a much better mix. There was some pretty good comedy, but there was also a setting with a thrilling story and good set pieces.

I know that I watched the second film in the franchise, but I didn't really feel lost through the runtime. In fact, I kind of preferred this because we got into the action pretty quick.

I really like the concept of a woman spirit that scares the men of a town. And it felt like there was a worthy story here, rather than just milking out a sequel for financial gain. I felt the fear amongst the characters, in the right ways.

It is still hard to take this film too seriously though. There is still too much silliness to elevate it to a memorable status.

2024-12-22,The Holiday,2006,https://boxd.it/87mBnd,4,,"A fun rom-com!

I was excited to check out a classic Christmas rom-com. There are a plethora of new ones every year on Netflix, but I’m slowly losing the charm with straight-to-Netflix content like this because they feel like content for content sake and don’t feel like they are trying to make a lasting connection with the audience. So it was very refreshing to see this stark difference with this film. 

I was pretty surprised with how emotional I got with certain parts. I’ll shamelessly excuse some of that to watching this on a ski bus after many snowboarding falls, and maybe my head was hit in a certain way to feel more emotional. While everyone else was sleeping, here I was fighting back tears while watching this film. 
That being said, I’m glad that this film didn’t focus on just the romances. There were other subplots that got emotional and cared about the characters. The subplot with Kate Winslet helping the elderly man in particular, was charming. It was easy to cheer for these characters when they were truly good at heart. 

Never in a million years could I have seen Kate Winslet and Jack Black be a couple. This film made that believable. I welcome more rom-coms where actors don’t have chemistry on paper, but actually have a lot to explore on screen. 

My main flaw is that I really don’t like romance films that start with one-night stands. This conveys a feeling that physical connection is more important, and the emotional connection is not as important. I wish this could be more hindered in films, but unfortunately that doesn’t seem the be the direction we are headed. 

A very easy nitpick is that there is no way any of this plot could actually happen in reality. There would have to many conveniences for people to switch houses and have everything work out in the end. But hey, that is some of the joy of film - escapism.

My favorite part was Cher's voiceover through the film for it's unexpected comedy. The stream of consciousness appears well-thought out, but it is also the thoughts of a teenage spoiled brat so it goes superficial and haphazard directions. The best voiceover was when she realized that she liked a certain boy (avoiding spoilers here). That voiceover definitely kept the film going for me. I understand why this film has cult classic status at the time of its release - there are definitely many quotable moments.

Ultimately, I don't think the film worked for me as well as I wanted it to. It felt too slice-of-life in that there wasn't a clear major plotline or clear character motivations. I guess that is in line with how a teenager thinks, but it made it hard to root in a certain direction. 

Also, Cher as the main character seemed odd for me. I understand she is privileged and clueless (no pun intended), but she does do some dumb decisions that made me not like her.

2024-12-24,Lucky Baskhar,2024,https://boxd.it/88ZjrD,4.5,,"What a refreshing take on the crime epic genre!

In a way, there are many crime epics out there of a similar structure - <i>Scarface </i>and <i>The Wolf of Wall Street </i>do it well in a film format, <i>Breaking Bad </i>does it well in a television format. While I love the above content, what set this apart was that it was produced as a Telugu film. Therefore, we could get the same thrilling moments of a crime epics in a more enjoyable manner from a family friendly perspective. For example, there is no drug trading or drug use happening here; it is purely to make more money. So, we don’t have any of those scenes of the protagonist being super high on cocaine or meddling with prostitutes or leaving his family. Instead, we see a normal father through the whole process. We see the effects of his power-hungry nature and how he loses a part of himself over time, but you are still able to sympathize because you know he still has a good heart for his family. 

I also appreciated how much detail went into the process itself. We saw very clear visuals of how money was stolen from the bank, and how that process gets escalated over time. We even continued to see how stressed our protagonist was when things seemed to go wrong, further the feeling that we want him to succeed despite committing a crime. 

Without spoiling anything, the film diverts from the overall “rise and fall” trope here. There could be an argument about if this is the moral way to end it and if people could take away the wrong message. Personally, I think the ending made sense given the situation. 

My one flaw is that there some Telugu comedy tropes that really didn’t need to be there. It was almost as if the film producers insisted some of that content had to be included to let the film get a pass. 

A slight nitpick is that some parts were overexplained, when they were already pretty obvious. I prefer this problem over underexplaining, but still worth pointing out.",,2024-12-23

I was thinking that the trailers revealed too much about this film, because it brings up the fact that the protagonist may have been the cause of the court case he is in the jury for. This normally would've been a third act twist in a movie. What I didn't realize was that this is a reveal near the beginning of the film. This was a great choice, because it makes you put yourself in the shoes of the protagonist and think about how you would handle it. This brings forth thrills through a slow-burn pace.

The additional details around the film were also properly chosen. For example, the background of the protagonist makes you want to root for him even if he may be doing something wrong. The inclusion of political campaign prospects from the district attorney muddied the waters in the best ways. The conversations amongst the other jury members are very realistic. I even liked how they showed certain details of the jury process, such as how certain people try to get out of the jury duty. 

What slightly lost me was the ending. Without spoiling anything, it seemed like it was trying to do multiple endings instead of committing to one.

I'm not sure why this film in particular got so much awards love. I'm glad Morgan Freeman has an Oscar, but I didn't feel that much of an impactful performance from him here. Hilary Swank's performance was admirable, but I didn't think it was iconic either.

I think my main flaw was that the film wanted to subvert the underdog sports drama premise but didn't do it effectively. Hilary Swank's character starts off as a perfect fighter, and I wanted more struggle from her to feel like she was a human that deserves people to root for her. I didn't link Clint Eastwood's character as a coach - we didn't get much background from him to understand why he makes certain decisions (e.g. not coaching women initially).

One thing I appreciated was that there weren’t unnecessary romantic subplots here.

It is easy to jokes about how terrible the special effects are with the birds here. Yes, it totally doesn't hold up. But, the film still successfully displayed fear with the birds. Somehow, an everyday natural thing like birds could be scarier than giant mecha-machines wreaking havoc. I think the reason why the fears worked is because birds should be such innocent creatures. The fact that a normal innocent creature suddenly hurts people is terrifying - when do you know when it is safe to venture out? 

The film makes an interesting choice to follow a meet-cute for most of the beginning. I think this was done to follow a specific set of characters behaving rather innocently, and then suddenly see their lives horrifically affected by the birds. But, the setup here was a bit odd. It required the main heroine to drive a long way just to give lovebirds to the hero, and every detail of this journey was depicted. For a while, I was questioning if I was even watching the right movie. Ultimately, I feel mixed about this choice. It was refreshing to not appear like a horror movie until the horrific events actually started occurring, but the meet-cute situation had too many oddities.

2024-12-29,The King of Comedy,1982,https://boxd.it/8degEZ,5,,"This was a huge surprise for me. 

It was on my watchlist for its cult status and a collaboration between Robert de Niro and Martin Scorsese, but in my head I still went into it to watch it as a chore. While I respect both of them, their content can be too slow-paced for my personal liking.
However, this film was completely different from the other content I've seen.

What really took me aback was Robert de Niro's performance. I always viewed Robert de Niro as a seasoned and perfected mob boss that makes others fear him. This role was completely opposite to that. This proves to me that Robert de Niro has huge range. I totally believed him as an aspiring and deranged comedian. I totally believed him as an underdog that just has something so off about him. It made you pity him and fear him at the same time, which is such an odd feeling to have towards someone. 
Frankly, this felt much scarier than traditional horror films to me. I heard that celebrities at the time feared this film because of how well it resembled actual stalkers. 
Also, huge respect to Robert de Niro for how much dedication he put into this role. He went to his own stalkers to learn from them. His comedic timing in his sets were natural. I genuinely didn't see the actor in this performance, which makes sense once you see the effort he put into it.

A couple choices really elevated this film beyond what a quick pitch would convey. The mix of real events with Rupert Pupkin's fantasies made you understand why he thought he deserved the big stage. The constant mispronounciation of his name by others were believable microtriggers that would have led him to his derangement. The fact that he was actually a great comedian made it even harder for you to not root for him.

2024-12-31,Joker: Folie à Deux,2024,https://boxd.it/8eXbdt,0.5,,"Respect the huge risky swing, but it was a huge miss.

Nothing about this should have been approved. The first film was a solid standalone film that turned the superhero genre over its head. Sure, some people had justifiable criticisms, but overall that first film had an admirable legacy. It had a solid beginning, middle, and end. It would be really risky to release a sequel and potentially tarnish this legacy.

I'll admit that I was intrigued by the buildup to this film's release. The inclusion of Harley Quinn excited me - I yearn for a Harley Quinn character study film. And Lady Gaga's casting seemed perfect. All of the creative team came back for this film. The film was announced to be a musical. That's a huge swing, and I wanted to see this film just to respect that. The first teaser was also intriguing - the scene with Lady Gage drawing a smile with lipstick and then Joaquin Phoenix smiling over it was a beautiful shot.

Unfortunately, everything about this was a disappointment. Genuinely nothing happened through the runtime. Musical sequences were haphazardly and awkwardly placed - they were a sharp contrast from the tone of the scene, the songs weren't catchy enough to be memorable, and it seemed odd to watch these characters break out into song.

I had no understanding for the inclusion of Lady Gaga's character. I felt like there was actually no chemistry between her and Joaquin Phoenix. This was a new character that was thrown into the mix, and the film seemed to try pushing us that they have a valuable relationship wtih depth, but I felt nothing between the two of them.

Arguably even worse is the budget - it makes no sense for this film to cost $200 million. I could've gotten the same film with maybe 1% of that budget. It was just set in courtrooms and prisons the whole time.

The film takes a while to set up. But once the terrorism parts kick in, it gets really fun to watch. You can't help but put yourself in the shoes of the protagonist and think how you would solve the situation.

What really surprised me was Jason Bateman as the antagonist. On one hand, his character had a lot of the same mannerisms and delivery as what Jason Bateman typically does in other performances. On the other hand, it didn't feel out of place when a terrorist character was performing in that way - it actually added an odd unhinged and unpredictable feel to his character.

Taron Egerton proves to be a solid lead here. I didn't doubt it after the <i>Kingsman </i>movies, but this shows that he can take on more range across the spotlight.

Around the second half was when it became somewhat typical in that over-the-top scenes took place. It felt like they were done to include the thrilling fights, but they were somewhat out of place from the rest of the movie, given that the characters weren't really set up as people that can fight. Also, most of the action/chase scenes with Sofia Carson definitely weren't realistic with how they were filmed. Overall, if you think about it too much, plot threads in the second half weren't fully tied up (or tied up in a realistic manner) based on how they were set up in the first half. 
That being said, it was very easy to forget about these inconsistencies as I was caught up in all the thrills through the film.

Sidebar - it seemed odd to make our main characters not actually be married. They thoroughly acted like a married couple, given that they live together and are expecting a child. I understand these type of relationships exist, but this choice didn't really end up adding anything to the plot so I didn't get it's purpose.

2025-01-04,Zwigato,2022,https://boxd.it/8j6Wxp,4,,"A slice-of-life adventure of an everyday food delivery person.

I knew nothing about this film going into it. It was refreshing to encounter a film I knew nothing about and have a positive reaction, I do wish to experience that more (unfortunately I don't, given how much I follow movie news).

For those that don't know - the protagonist is someone that lost his factory job, and in a need of any income he becomes a food delivery person for a fictional Grubhub-like app called ""Zwigato"". 

It's impossible to watch this film and not feel pity for the protagonist. He, like many others today, are negatively affected by the increased technology dependence of the world. They grew up with factory skills that are irrelevant now, and struggle with adapting to technology to make a living. Even something as simple as navigating a smartphone requires much learning. Being a food delivery person feels like a step down in status, especially when working for high status people. And it is fully dependent on people using the app to order food, which means the income is variable.
The film makes a great choice to show this story from his perspective. On one side, you have to accept the nature of dealing with frustrating people. On the other hand, it makes you feel bad that he has to be subjected to that.

This film makes you really appreciate what you have, and reminds you to care for all people around you. It makes you want to give a gift card to your garbage truck driver.

My flaw is the personal qualm I typically have with slice-of-life films. When a film presents a problem, we have a natural tendency to have the protagonist try to solve that problem. Here, we just see what the realistic life of a food delivery person looks like. Of course we root for him, but what exact outcome are we rooting for?

I knew that this film was about de-aging Demi Moore and that it had really gross body horror, to the point where I was told that I shouldn't eat while watching this movie. I went into the film feeling thankful that I knew what I was getting into, but in hindsight I wish I knew less about it because I think it didn't feel as much of an impact from it.

My favorite part of this film is the look of it. The brightly colored cinematography complimented well with the urge to become as attractive as possible - it may look pretty, but does that mean it is right? At times, it was so bright that it was blinding in the right ways.

There are a couple shots that are perfect in my opinion. The opening montage in particular, was jarring. Kudos to the editing team here. A scene when Demi Moore was getting ready for a date was also great. 

I am happy that a really weird film like this is getting so much awards attention. Demi Moore and Margaret Qualley were perfectly cast in these roles, and kudos to them for taking on something so weird. 
That being said, if you think about it long enough, many things don't make logical sense. For example, if the substance makes another being that is separate from the current being, is the current being even gaining anything positive from the substance? And why do things go wrong in the specific ways shown when you don't follow the rules?
Overall, the shock horror didn't work that well for me. Commendable prosthetics and visual effects for sure, but they didn't seem to have a believable purpose other than shocking film viewers. In contrast, the gross-out practical effects in <i>The Thing </i>were appropriate because they were established as extraterrestrial aliens that were making people fear for their lives. While we film viewers were shocked by the visuals in <i>The Thing</i>, it was clear that the main purpose of those choices were to shock the characters in the film. 
I almost wish the body horror aspect of this movie didn’t exist, so that it could just focus on the social commentary around impossible female beauty expectations.

We all grew up watching the slapstick fun of <i>Tom and Jerry</i>, <i>Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner</i>, and <i>Charlie Chaplin</i> amongst others. These aren't top quality art, but they are timeless fun. It undoubtedly felt refreshing to encounter humor like that again in this film.

What made this slapstick comedy stand out was actually how much attention span was required through the runtime. All the physical gags were recurring and built upon each other (e.g. wind blows out a fire, human makes fire again and sits in position to block wind, wind changes direction, human repeats, wind then blows from multiple directions). To fully follow these jokes and references, you had to closely watch through. A brief look in your smartphone would make you miss the introduction of a new gag, and then not understand what is going on when that gag is reintroduced. Despite the silly slapstick comedy, it felt very smartly crafted.

At the end of the day, this is still a silly slapstick. There isn't much coherent plot or character development or anything like that. Other than what was stated above, there isn't much more that stands out here. Still a recommended watch if you want a reliable laugh.",,2025-01-09

I’ve been on the Ridley Scott hype train recently, and obviously this one has been on the watchlist for some time as an iconic film of his. I knew it would be very different from <i>Alien </i>and <i>Gladiator</i>, but I didn’t expect to love it so much. 

It’s the type of movie that just wouldn’t be made today. A modern version of this movie would make the main characters bratty social media influencers and overly promiscuous and force a romantic relationship between them. Instead, this film just focuses on a normal escapism journey. A tale of two girl friends needing time away from the real world feels so much more refreshing when set in a pre-smartphone period. 

The direction and setting is nothing without the performances of Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis. It was so easy to root for them. Sure, there is some level of brat to them, but that brought out the right amount of fun and feeling to the film. More importantly, they were just everyday people looking for an escape from reality. We all can relate. So when things go wrong in their journey (even when we know and they know that their actions are wrong), we just want them to get out scot-free. 

What makes this film stick even more is that it just perfects the ending. It was both surprising and it totally fit what the whole film set up for. Not to mention, an iconic picture even to this day. 

The Brad Pitt appearance was hilarious. Even funnier that other people who auditioned for that role are A-listers today (e.g. George Clooney, Robert Downey Jr.). 

There is no way to describe Ridley Scott. He’s excelled in literally every genre - cutting-edge in sci-fi, historical epics, and even modern realistic journeys like this. 
I commend him even more after learning the behind-the-scenes story of how this film got made. The idea was thrown around and then denied by many. Then Ridley Scott saw it and appreciated it, but wanted someone else to take it on. He then took it on once no one else did and Michelle Pfeiffer convinced him to take it. And then gets a Best Director nomination for it (I normally would be pissed he didn’t win, but <i>The Silence of the Lambs </i>is tough competition). It’s admirable that he turned the project into what it is today.",,2025-01-11
2025-01-13,Murder on the Orient Express,2017,https://boxd.it/8rEMlX,2,,"Unfortunately boring.

This has been on my list for a while because it turned into a franchise, and it is a mystery movie. To me, mystery movies are like action movies in that most of them are at least entertaining enough to watch through the runtime. In fact, mystery movies may even have more going for them because they are a lot more rare.

It's definitely cool to see a huge cast here. And I appreciate how much was put into making this feel like it's from the 1930s, especially with the setup before going into the train.

The main thing working against this movie was that it was just boring. None of the possible suspects had enough odd characteristics to remember them enough while trying to solve the mystery. Hercule Poirot as a character was okay, but easily not the same charming level as <i>Knives Out</i>'s Benoit Blanc or Sherlock Holmes. 
I wanted to love this to match the passion that Kenneth Branagh has with directing, producing, and starring in thsi film. But I just couldn't get there.

There was nothing horrible about this movie. It follows the mystery formula well, and I myself didn't see the ending coming at all. But at the same time, there isn't much excitement here to recommend it.",,2025-01-12
2025-01-19,Mystery Men,1999,https://boxd.it/8wwC6d,2,,"This might be the point when I officially state that I'm not charmed by oddball comedies anymore.

I used to seek out this genre of oddball comedies (e.g. <i>The Hangover</i>, <i>This is the End</i>, <i>Pineapple Express</i>) when I was a young adult because I was so ready to take in all the raunchy and silly humor. Now, I'm not charmed by it anymore. I get too held up by the plot inconsistencies that clearly don't get as much attention.

I will also admit that I probably am much less excited about this movie because I'm totally watching it after all the superhero fatigue. Since there are so many superhero movies out there now, a somewhat spoof on superhero movies doesn't have much appeal. Contrast this to the <i>Austin Powers </i>franchise, which was very popular because it made fun of <i>James Bond </i>movies. There aren't multiple <i>James Bond </i>movies per year, so a spoof on that genre has more charm.

The main thing I'll remember about this movie is that it was the true movie that was first associated with Smash Mouth's <i>All Star</i> (although obviously <i>Shrek </i>is the one that popularized it).

Nothing about this film makes me mad really. It is overall harmless. There are some funny ideas and jokes. I think they are really just good for a comedy sketch, because it felt drawn out in a feature film length.",,2025-01-18
2025-01-20,A Different Man,2024,https://boxd.it/8xjESL,4,,"This film is to <i>The Substance</i>, as <i>Whiplash </i>is to <i>Black Swan</i>.

Very interesting that this came out in the same year as <i>The Substance</i>, as both involve a premise of someone being insecure with their own body, going through a medical process to solve that body problem, and then experience senses of regret. <i>The Substance </i>went the direction of body horror, this one went the direction of a dark comedy. 
Personally, I liked this direction better. This one focused much more on the impact of everything to our protagonist, Edward. It was easy to understand that he would be socially awkward with his neurofibromatosis condition and want to do anything to cure it. It was easy to believe that he would be jealous of Oswald, with the same condition but is much more confident.
On that note, it was a great choice to make Oswald a confident human where the neurofibromatosis condition doesn't actually come up (outside of the play). As the viewer, we clearly see he has the condition so the film just focuses on his personality and how his friends treat him. 

All things brings together good social commentary discussions on if you really have impediments or if they are resolvable with an attitude shift.

I will say that the ending lost me a bit. It went in a direction of too much craziness in the third act. They seemed to go towards ""Oscar bait scenes"" and didn't feel like a natural progression to earn those moments.
While I liked the subdued and slow-burn direction, there were some moments that I felt either dragged or didn't need to exist.

More a nitpick, but I have serious logical doubts with someone actually being able to fake their own death. 

Cool to see Sebastian Stan outside of the MCU. Hope we get to see more of him in other serious ventures.

Overall a recommended watch. Good for those that are intrigued by the concept of <i>The Substance </i>but don't want body horror.",,2025-01-19

I didn't realize until the end of the film that this was actually a true story (apart from the cinematic liberties). I already liked the film by the end of it, but I have more appreciation after reading up the background of Major Mukund Varadarajan and seeing that the film was actually consistent with his overall life story.

The film makes a choice to focus on Mukund's personal love life, as well as his military journey. Normally this would frustrate me, but here it was done in both a realistic emotional manner and in a way where his wife didn't come off as a useless figure simply there to support her husband. She brought forth valuable impact to the story.
It was very easy to root for Mukund through the runtime. He had all the qualities of an ideal gentleman by being there for his family and his military peers.
Since both aspects of the story were gripping, I didn't feel the length of the near three hour runtime.

One flaw I had is that there were a couple overly cinematic moments around the war violence that felt oddly edited and unrealistic.

This film is a solid watch and I definitely recommend, but admittedly I don't see this being as memorable as other war films out there.",,2025-01-19

The plot was all over the place, everything seemed like was filmed in chunks and not in one cohesive unit.

Movies like this make me fear watching any Telugu movie blind.

2025-01-24,Grave of the Fireflies,1988,https://boxd.it/8APJ19,4.5,,"Probably the best war movie I've seen from the perspective of civilians.

I obviously haven't lived in the middle of a warzone so I don't know what it's truly like, but I imagine it would be similar to this film. In the moment, being able to organize fair care to all civilians seems impossible. I would expect it to be much more like a ""every man for himself"" situation where we actually see the worst of humanity. I think we see this type of mentality in the zombie genre (e.g. <i>The Last of Us</i>) but I don't think I've seen it in a war movie until now. This is what sets this film apart for me. We see strangers that are not willing to give lost children food and shelter. It's harsh, but you believe that is how people actually behave at times like this. 

There are a lot of things that should put you down as you watch it (apart from the obvious war zone setting). With the opening shot, we know where the characters ultimately end up, which brings a sense of dread through the runtime. Of all characters, we follow children through the film, who deserve to experience joy at their age and not survival skills. 
Yet at the same time, the film is able to bring in hope. Seita as the older brother is well past his age in maturity as he does everything he can to care for his little sister, Setsuko.

I have mixed feelings on the choice to make Seita avoid the obvious opportunities to keep food and shelter (e.g. continue staying with his aunt). I understand the perspective that he values pride in himself, and that was getting tarnished as he stayed with his aunt. I also understand that he is ultimately a child so we shouldn't expect perfectly thought-out decision-making from him. But at the same time, it still feels unwise given the warzone setting.

This movie is from 1988, but it really doesn't feel that way. I never felt like the animation or dialogue or general production was dated. If I felt this way from watching it almost 50 years later - this may be the truest timeless classic to exist.

This is also a solid example of how animation doesn't mean catered to children. Despite its dark subject matter, I don't think it would've hit the same if this was a live-action film.

I knew that he is known for surrealist films, which doesn't sound like my cup of tea, but I still wanted to expose myself to it. I knew nothing about this film going into it (or even if it is a true embodiment of David Lynch as a director).

I will appreciate that I've never seen a film like this before. It starts out as an intriguing mystery, and then goes some odd places but admittedly I was still interested to see how it would go.
That's probably my favorite part of the film. It's a mystery, but the mystery isn't really the point of the film. In a way, it's a coming-of-age exploration of an awkward college student seeking some adventure and ending up getting tied up in some weird stuff.

Personally, scenes went directions that were too weird for me. I appreciate the uniqueness and riskiness (which does make them memorable), but at the same time they felt like shock for the sake of shock instead of having dedicated meaning.

There probably is a fair amount to analyze here, from the visual symbolism to the specific editing choices. Personally, I didn't care enough to explore that further, but I'm sure there is some interesting stuff to find there.

It is hard to critique this film because I know that it is basically a true story of the author that the film is based on. Usually, I err on the side of bringing more of the actual moments into true story films. But in this case, I think I needed more creative liberties taken to turn it into a better story.

This film is based on the fact that someone is going through a form of a ""mid-life crisis"" and travels to three different countries and experiences self-discovery. The problem for me was that I didn't fully buy that this character was actually going through a crisis. I didn't buy that her marriage was giving her unhappiness, or that she was even going through tough times. So the subsequent story of her journey didn't have the weight for me that the film wanted me to feel.
A potential part of this was that I don't think that Julia Roberts was the right casting choice. Julia Roberts embodies perfection, and this character needed to feel more like someone that didn't have their life together.

I also couldn't stand Richard Jenkins's character in the film. He just came off as annoying to the main character, and took away from the actual benefits that could be experienced from her time in the ashram in India. 

This film didn't make me mad though. There were definitely nice moments. The Thanksgiving celebration in Italy was fun. Indonesia scenes looked breathtaking. Julia Roberts is always a charismatic and enjoyable watch. But, the sum of the parts didn't work for me.",,2025-01-28

The film opens with an unsolved heist 15 years prior, and then continues to jump between 15 years prior and present day. This was a risky choice that I thought was very weird to do for a mystery movie, but ultimately it worked great for me. This provided an interesting game of continuously switching sides between the suspect and investigation officer. I genuinely had no idea how the film was going to end, which made me thrilled through the watch. 

I was surprised that the film never dragged, despite its runtime. It felt like something was always happening. There were many twists and turns going on, and none of them seemed too over-the-top to me. Even if I didn't buy into them at first (e.g. a love story between suspects), they all eventually felt earned to me given the situations at hand. I particularly liked the amount of mind games continuously being played, and how much they mentally affected each other.

The main thing that didn't work for me was the 15 year jump. I couldn't buy this for maybe a 5 year jump, but 15 years made no sense. The only reason I could see for increasing the time length here is to embody the phrase ""I won, but at what cost?"".",,2025-01-31
2025-02-01,Saturday Night,2024,https://boxd.it/8GT8kl,2.5,,"This is a movie about the origin of <i>Saturday Night Live</i> - that is obviously interesting enough. The filmmakers decided to make a risky choice to only show the two hours prior to the first episode, in real-time format. I had a mixed feeling about this.
The positive about this choice is that it feels chaotic in a thrilling manner. It has the <i>Uncut Gems </i>feel of lots of stressful things falling apart and you hoping it can all be solved by the end. It also is great for embodying the scrappy underdog feel of many young adults trying to disrupt the comedy space.
The negative about this choice is that we don't get enough of a background on how we got to this situation and who all the characters. This wouldn't be a problem for people that already know a lot about the original <i>SNL </i>crew. But, I am not one of those people. I admittedly didn't know most names shown here. I would've loved to know what the cast members went through to get the approval from NBC to make this show. I would've loved to know more about all the characters. So because of all this, it was difficult for me to join the stressful journey.
The main negative of the real-time format here is that it made everything feel less realistic. I could believe all the scenes actually happening, but I couldn't believe that it all happened within two hours of the show beginning. 

There are strong casting choices and some fun moments. But, I couldn't rave about this further due to the reasons above. You'll probably enjoy it more if you are a die-hard <i>SNL </i>fan.",,2025-01-31
2025-02-09,Pearl,2022,https://boxd.it/8LTFbh,4.5,,"Just when I thought I can't enjoy modern horror, this film comes around to surprise me!

While I was ultimately positive on <i>X</i>, I had no major energy to watch the rest of the franchise. That film felt like a normal slasher film done well enough. And this film has the same main actor and crew and sets and was surprisingly released within one year of the first film. So I expected this film to be very similar to the first. I was wrong - it has a very different feel. This is probably my favorite part about it - we have a franchise where the films are very different from each other. I want more of this - the closest we have is <i>Cloverfield</i>, and the exection of that franchise is strongly mixed.

This film reminded me of <i>Joker </i>in the best ways. We got an effective character study here. The film takes its time with establishing the setting, to make it believable when things turn south. The over-the-top nature isn't there simply to shock the audience - the actions make sense for the characters that are developed, and we the audience happen to get shocked by it. If more horror movies can do this, I will actually enjoy the horror genre.

Mia Goth seriously needed awards buzz for this performance. I thought she was great in the dual performance in <i>X </i>and didn't think that could get topped. I was wrong - she tops it here. Every expression and dialogue delivery was so unique and I can't imagine anyone else pulling that off. Most people would've come off as annoying, but she did it in the best creepy manner.
A scene in here is the true definition of the ""Oscar-winning moment"" for Mia Goth. Unfortunately, awards buzz is all defined by specific awards marketing campaigns and not on the actual best movies.

I really liked the setting of this film. While it was the same technical location as <i>X</i>, here we see it in fully lit times and during the 1910s and during the fear of the pandemic at that time. A better visual capture of the setting here made it much more investing for me.

My one flaw is that there are some promiscous portions that didn't need to be there. It seemed like they only included them to have some connection with <i>X</i>, but I didn't see a reason for it at all.

Overall, I didn't see a reason hate on the film so much for these reasons. I thought the film's choice to follow Chris Kyle's story was the right choice. The point of the film isn't necessarily the true historical events, but the impact of the war on a specific person. I didn't see much in this film that had any political commentary. If anything, there was a good exploration of toll that war has on killing people, even if they are on the other side of you in a war.

Chris Kyle obviously should be praised for how talented he was in the warzone, but we see the impact that the war has on him in his personal life and how difficult it is to forget the war when you're spending personal time with your family. Amongst the war scenes and an awards-worthy performance from Bradley Cooper, the best part of the film for me was the war's emotional impact on Chris Kyle. He gets praised for having a high number of kills, but you can see that a part of him is not proud of that. It makes it even more tragic that he ultimately lost his life too early while trying to help someone else with PTSD.

I've gone through a track of liking horror movies that are older (e.g. <i>The Thing</i>, <i>The Shining</i>, <i>Alien</i>). But, this may be the first old horror movie that didn't work for me.

First, the film opened with seemingly a lot of random setting details that didn't make sense to me. There was a fake claim that this is based on a true story, then that there is an epidemic, then that grave digger reports were occurring. I don't know why that was set that way, because ultimately only the grave digger piece really had an impact.

Then, I didn't buy into the premise of these characters getting themselves in such a situation. I get that they are teenagers so they do stupid things, but I didn't buy why they would travel to a slaughterhouse.

I was pretty surprised by the fact that there wasn't much runtime for tension or violence here. Kills happened very quickly - I guess this would be realistic, but I didn't have much time to care for the characters to feel sad about their deaths.

There are some moments I can praise. The weirdness around the enemy characters were off-putting in the right ways. But I just didn't feel enough fear.

2025-02-12,King Richard,2021,https://boxd.it/8OjLVl,4.5,,"A thrilling tale through the beginnings of the best tennis players ever. 

This has been on my watchlist for a very long time, but I finally watched it after seeing Serena Williams in the Super Bowl Halftime Show.

A normal sports film would’ve focused through the perspective of Serena and Venus Williams. This film makes a unique choice to focus on their father figure instead. This was risky because the obvious excitement would be from the famous tennis players, and typically the coach is just a side character. I believe this choice paid off well for this story, given how significant Richard was for the rise in Serena and Venus. 

It’s a lot more appreciative when you know present day, with the knowledge that Serena and Venus are the best in the game. I had no idea that they grew up in Compton, and how much their parents sacrificed for not just them but also their siblings. I had no idea that Venus was getting more of the attention initially. It’s really amazing that they accomplished what they did, given their background. 
The film could’ve been a lot heavier in the tone, but I’m glad they didn’t go that direction and instilled hope and appreciation for what you have. The energy and joy that the whole family had as a cohesive unit was beautiful to watch. 

I’m glad that this film was actually faithful to the real story and depicted it accurately. 

The tennis scenes were also really thrilling to watch, as if you were watching an actual tennis match. 

This is very much deserving of the Oscar for Will Smith. Unlike all his other serious performances, this one thoroughly stands out. He didn’t seem like Will Smith acting as someone - this was Richard himself. All the mannerisms felt like a real living person, and not as Will Smith.

As for flaws, I think there could’ve been improvement in the screenplay. It was odd to focus so much in certain parts (e.g. Venus’s tennis match at the end) and not seeing much of Serena’s journey. This could’ve used another round of editing to focus less on some scenes to give more time in other interesting areas.

I was excited for a quad reunion of Robert Zemeckis, Eric Roth, Tom Hanks, and Robin Wright after <i>Forrest Gump</i>. I know that many say Robert Zemeckis is past his prime, but I have been at the very least intrigued by how cutting-edge and risky he is on the technical side of things with his filmography. 

There is a good amount to appreciate here. Watching the same exact shot through all of time was a game that stayed fresh throughout the runtime. The film kept wanting to draw parallels between a past and present scene, which is why I believe they chose to not show scenes consecutively. I didn't fully buy connections that they were trying to make, and preferred that they didn't attempt this.
I could imagine some people throwing frustration at the fact that they had to keep forcing scenes to occur in this shot to keep the schtick of the single shot movie. I personally didn't feel that way, and felt that the scenes were believable enough to happen there.

I felt most of the emotional beats that the film was going for (e.g. financial struggles). They didn't land as well for me when it was going more in the social commentary direction though. I wish they kept it as a slice-of-life feel rather than trying to communicate a message.

Always impressed with Tom Hanks and his range. Robin Wright was great too.

The de-aging piece of it is definitely the best execution I've seen thus far. The behind-the-scenes of this is fascinating to watch - prior films utilized a much more manual effort in de-aging, but this film utilized AI to speed up the process and obtain better results. I was sold enough with the actors looking younger than they actually are, but I think it's not perfect yet. 
I was shocked at the CGI elements - they weren't horrible, but they didn't feel realistic enough and definitely don't think they meet the standards of what we expect from Robert Zemeckis. It's also surprising because the CGI is totally technology that has been perfected by now, but the de-aging effects (which most fail at) were great here.

My favorite part of this film is the unique style and perspective of the animation. It felt like a video game in the best ways. We see how this cat is navigating this open-world environment in a tracking first-person perspective. I felt like I was controlling where the cat was going. 
They also kept the environment of the film just mysterious enough without overexplaining the setting, just like how a lot of simple video games operate.

This film also perfectly capture the natural behaviors of the animals. The details on how each animal observed and moved were so realistic. It was very sweet watching a bunch of misfits from each animal type banding together, because you know that they normally wouldn't do so if it weren't for the situation at hand. The fact that I felt such an emotional connection to animals that can't talk is mindblowing.

My main flaw is that the feature-length runtime was a detriment. This is a solid concept for a short film, but it felt more dragged out with the longer runtime. 
There also doesn't feel to be an overall purpose or takeaway from the film. I don't care about this as much if the journey was amazing. But here, the longer runtime dragged the journey for me, so I needed more as a takeaway to have a stronger recommendation.",,2025-02-15

I knew literally nothing about this movie going into it. It was the first movie I've seen directed by George Clooney, so I was curious to see how he is behind the camera. I was throughly impressed with his direction here.

What this film showcased well is the detail of the behind-the-scenes of political campaigns. We all like throwing around that politicians are corrupt, but here we see how that reputation actually comes. The push from everyone to do whatever it takes to win (e.g. convince politicians for endorsements, try to win superdelegates, handing over high positions in exchange for endorsements). Basically, a lot of things that aren't even about making the policies that are best for their constituents. 

This is the type of political commentary films that I really enjoy - ones that don't directly comment on specific policies or incidents of real life, but set up an alternate world with the same rules as our current world, to make us pose interesting discussions and parallels to our current world.

I personally thought the pacing could've had more work, but it wasn't too slow to the point of being boring. There was also a romance subplot with the main character that I felt didn't need to exist - I would've preferred the main character to be more of the ""objective and naive lens"" that we watch the whole situation unfold through.

I was bored by the first film, but since I love mysteries so much I was still intrigued to watch the next one in the franchise. 

I found this film to be a step up from the first in a couple of ways. First, I had a better understanding of all the characters to internally play the mystery game as I was watching the movie. Second, the cinematography through the Nile was a nice watch (even if it appeared CGI heavy). Third, the opening was a surprisingly emotional watch that made me more interested in Hercule Poirot from the start.

Unfortunately, the main detriment is that it was too boring for me. The film doesn't have the charming tone that other mysteries have (e.g. <i>Knives Out</i>). The characters weren't quirky enough (or just generally interesting enough) to care about them. While I liked Hercule Poirot at the beginning from his opening, he soon felt like a typical everyday person doing a detective job. By the end, I lost the emotional connection on trying to figure out the solution of the mystery.

A nitpick, but the end of <i>Murder on the Orient Express </i>teases this film by Hercule Poirot getting a note to investigate a death on the Nile. But, the way this film turned out is that Hercule Poirot was involved in the group before the death happened. So it wouldn't make sense in the canon to end the first film in that way. 

I know that the next film in the franchise appears to have more a spooky feel. That is making me intererested enough to check it out, but if it ends up being similar to the first two films then I will become disappointed.",,2025-02-20

I decided to watch this movie because it was leaving a streaming service soon, and I like Denzel Washington and Antoine Fuqua. I did watch the first film in this franchise sometime ago - I don't remember much about it, but I don't remember it really being a stand-out movie. From the little that I remember, I think this film is better and I would be excited to check out the next installment.

I'm thankful I didn't need to brush up too much on the first film to be invested here. 

The best part of this is definitely Denzel Washington. He is a natural protagonist that doesn't lean into the ""I'm too old for this"" trope. I believed that he could do all the stunts that he did. 
What really stood out for me was his ""mentor role"" that he had with another character. It hit the right emotional beats without feeling derivative.

While the plot all went in believable directions, I did enjoy the journey.

The third act of this film felt really out of place. It felt like a video game boss level. It was cool for sure, but didn't fit with the first two acts that were more of a slow burn.

All in all, I recommend watching!",,2025-02-21
2025-02-24,Unforgiven,1992,https://boxd.it/8VOvWH,3,,"A good western story, but no need to seek it out. 

The film started it out gripping, from the perspective of prostitutes in an olde town world being wronged by their society. Then we are introduced to our protagonist, a cowboy that is past his prime that could bring the rightful justice. 

Unfortunately, I don’t think execution of this really worked. Clint Eastwood’s character came off as way too old to realistically be able to do the deed, so it was hard to believe he could do his ultimate actions in the end. I also didn’t see enough about his character to understand his true motivations and why he was the right person to follow the story. 

I didn’t realize Morgan Freeman was in the movie, it was a nice surprise to see him. 

It felt surreal to watch this right before it was announced that Gene Hackman passed away. 

I don’t really know why this was so praised. On one side I wish we could get back to a time where action dramas are awards worthy. But, I can’t imagine this really being memorable amongst other movies out there.

2025-02-28,Do the Right Thing,1989,https://boxd.it/8Ys9mP,1.5,,"Unfortunately I don’t agree with the praise here. It came off way too disjointed for me. 

I was intrigued enough with the slice-of-life Bedford–Stuyvesant, Brooklyn setting, even if I didn’t fully connect with the cultures. I didn’t really like any of the characters because everyone had moments of rude behavior, but I was willing to give it the benefit of the doubt that this is making it more realistic. 

What the film ended up turning into frankly felt really wrong to me. It was clearly meant to have commentary on race relations and the police. People seem to love this movie because of such commentary. I personally don’t have much wrong with commentary, but I felt it was portrayed horribly. It gave the takeaway that mass riots are defendable, even towards people that don’t even deserve it. I definitely couldn’t side with the protagonists of the film because they were set up with bad behaviors in the beginning too.

The best part of this film is definitely how unique and silly every aspect of it is. Even the premise is so silly. The idea of a husband faking his wife’s kidnapping is so stupid, and it’s even stupider when you see how incompetent he is. I can’t imagine a comedy today executing such a concept. It wouldn’t be possible without unnecessary raunchy humor today. 

I also loved the Minnesotan setting. It’s easy to poke fun at everyone’s accents and Midwest nice culture, but the truth is it’s so refreshing to see this in film. Movies tend to be set in the same big city locations, and I yearn for more diverse settings through the country in film. 
I smiled at how committed this film was to keeping the Minnesotan accents and flair in all conversations. In particular, the banter between the cop and her husband were adorable to watch. 

This film seemed to be truly loved in awards season, and to this date is a classic amongst many people. Frankly, I don’t see how. It was unique with its comedy and story, but I don’t feel there was too much memorable about it.

2025-03-02,Dìdi (弟弟),2024,https://boxd.it/8ZMdYd,5,,"The rare coming-of-age film that connected with me perfectly. 

This wasn’t because the main family is Asian, or because it was all based in Fremont (although I felt proud watching that). It was because the film accurately captured teenage life, rather than a cinematic version of teenage life. 

I could immediately tell this film was different based on the looks of the cast. Teenagers had acne and didn’t have an abundance of makeup. They talked in an unfiltered manner in ways that teenagers actually would. Nothing about this felt glamorous, and that’s what I connected to - teenage life is not glamorous. 

It was also refreshing to see a protagonist that actually was more on the introverted scale. We can tell Chris has complex thought processes, despite the words coming out being a bit awkward. He had the most screen time, but not the most dialogue. I saw a lot of myself in him in a way. Often times I feel like I am a side character in the real world because I live from surrounding peoples’ experiences. That was captured perfectly with Chris’s interactions with everyone else. 

The struggle for fitting in was also captured perfectly here. The way people say certain mean things make total sense. You can tell that they don’t actually mean it, but they say it because they think it’s what they need to do to be popular. And that feels important as a teenager. 
Chris was the right protagonist to view this from, because he doesn’t fully commit in various decisions. He has feelings for a girl, and a relationship with this person would give him street cred, but he doesn’t fully act on it because it doesn’t feel right to him. He finds a new group of friends which connects with him in certain ways but they also aren’t genuinely right for him either. 

College topics in coming-of-age films are typically frustrating for me because most films focus on teenagers being rowdy, but at the same time casually talking about going to Stanford. This film perfectly captured the annoying competitive nature of college talk and the negative impacts it can have on people. 

This film had the right balance between showing slice-of-life pictures of teenage life, while also having a cohesive enough story. Some could potentially say it needed a more cohesive story, but I didn’t feel that way.

On paper, this definitely has the structure of a gripping political thriller. I would totally be into a political thriller of scandals and drawn-out votes in US elections. But because this was about a church process, I didn't have as much personal investment.

I didn't feel there was much else here to grip me. The performances and cinematography all felt relatively normal to me. Not bad, but not stellar enough to wow me.

I commend that this is one of the few competitive awards films that is actually rated below PG-13. I feel that taboo topics in awards films are unnecessarily included, so it was refreshing to see a film that skirted all those tendencies.

Parodies these days are ""so bad, it's good"". They usually contain lazy jokes and don't try to actually make a good movie. They aren't like the quality of <i>Airplane! </i>or <i>Spaceballs </i>where the parodies are actually good enough to be remembered and have a legacy.

I'm glad that this film fits more in the area to be remembered.

The film knows that it can't match the hype of <i>Top Gun </i>or other movies it references, and it doesn't try to. Jokes are funny if you get the references, and also if you don't get the references. Everything is silly, but you are also still rooting for the characters in the right ways.

With my expectations being so low, they did ultimately get exceeded here. I'm not in love with the movie, but I am at least intrigued by the directorial style of Ruben Ostlund.

I love the entire concept of this movie. Unlike every other movie involving bickering couples, this one was so realistic. It wasn't over-the-top. It was just enough to make anyone understand the arguments, which made it even more investing. Despite the huge beautiful scope of a ski resort in the Alps, the more interesting part was the way this couple interacted together.

This concept was the perfect showcase for Ruben Ostlund's directorial style. There were many long and still one-shot scenes, forcing the viewer to brood into what is getting built up. It made the feel both off-putting and thrilling at the same time.

Where the film lost me was with its ending. Without spoiling anything, I came out of it thinking ""so what?"". The ending felt disappointing, given how well the setup was.

It’s still so refreshing to see a story-first monster disaster movie. It genuinely felt like the filmmakers concocted an everyday emotionally investing story, and then incorporated Godzilla into it. Nothing felt like story beats that were generated in an assembly line and haphazardly stitched together. 

I further appreciated the look of Godzilla in this movie. It looked cool and scary in the right ways, and didn’t feel like everyday CGI. 

This is a rare disaster movie that I think anyone would really love.

However, I don't think this film did anything interesting enough with that setup. I didn't care enough to see where the story went or how the characters would react. I definitely didn't see the point of incorporating a western vibe for this story either.

This is totally a cult classic that still works well in the current day. The fun feels natural and not forced. The joy from the surfers is infectious. Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze are iconic casting here. Even though this is ultimately an average quality film for me, I won't forget it due to it's unique surfer personality.

Whenever my logic brain turned on, I couldn't appreciate the movie as much. The plot is an undercover FBI agent learning surfing, becoming a surfer bro, and being in a dilemma about if he should support the law or his new surfer friends.

Personally, I think I would've loved this film a lot more if I watched it at the time of release. The historical events referenced would've been more recent for me to connect to. I would've been completely mindblown by the visuals through the desert. I would've been super into the epic journey that didn't really exist in other venues.

Seeing it in today's standards felt more like a chore. The main thing bringing it down for me is how ""typical"" this screenplay is. It's the same structure as <i>Avatar </i>and <i>Pocahontas</i> - someone goes to a new culture, sees their value, battles on behalf of the new culture. I totally understand now why this formula feels so tired now - there were many versions of this film in the past. I'm sure I'll feel the same way whenever I eventually see <i>Dances with Wolves</i>.

I definitely appreciate how this film impacted modern cinema. The large, practical sets are commendable, especially considering they were done in the 1960s. The large runtime is mostly justified, but I got bored once I observed it was a screenplay that's been overused by this point.

The former was trashed by critics, this one was praised by critics. I couldn't believe that this film could be praised so much, so I watched this film with the expectation to trash these critics.

I went in with low expectations because the erotic thriller genre just doesn't work for me. It is clear that the goal is impose sensual feelings into the audience, which doesn't sit well with me. 

This film was better than I expected because actions surprisingly felt justified given the situations. While I don't agree with the actions that set all this off, it was set up in a way where you could understand why the first wrong move was acted upon. And then after that point, the rabbit hole of continuing the actions to avoid blackmail. Seeing Harris Dickinson's character fully act upon that was lowkey humorous to watch.

My favorite part of this is the premise. I like the world of clones being possible but totally looked down upon. The film posed a couple ethical situations in regards to clones that made me pretty scared about the prospect of clones.

I liked the look of the film too. Most modern sci-fi films come off as CGI-heavy. This one had a more mid-budget feel. This choice allowed more personality to shine. The spaceship felt dirty and lived-in. There was a focus to flesh out the characters and their plights. The humor actually fit in, and didn't come off as unnecessary quips.

Robert Pattinson's accent felt like a very weird choice at first because it made me see him as an idiot at first, but I got used to it after a while.

What really didn't work for me was the inclusion of anti-capitalism social commentary. The most interesting part for me was the clone aspect. However, there was an attempt to make this movie have commentary on other things (e.g. corrupt politicians, animal cruelty, etc.). Once it tried to do a little of everything, it turned into a bit of a mess.

I have huge respect for Bong Joon Ho and I look forward to seeing more of his filmography. It's clear that he has interest in anti-capitalism social commentary.

I really like the commentary that this had about the unhealthy fascination with the true crime genre. I always felt like it was an odd obsession that people had, so it felt like good payback to see this episode poke fun at it.

Unfortunately, this one didn't work for me. I almost think that Wes Anderson's style was more solidified in his later works that I've watched, and this film was just a work in progress to get there. 
Personally, the deadpan humor tone really didn't work for the story being told. With a story of a father trying to connect back to his children, I just couldn't feel the emotional beats amongst the silliness of the setting and the deadpan humor.

Other than the autism part, it felt like the film just threw all the action thriller archetypes together.

The best part of this film for me is Charlie Sheen's character. I like that we are immediately thrown into the Vietnam War from the perspective of a US soldier that is out of place. He struggles with basic weather aspects in Vietnam, and doesn't fit in with the personalities of the other soldiers. This is the best way to have the audience (a.k.a. common person) view a lens of what the warzone is like. And through the runtime we fully agree with his feelings.

This film also made me realize that I haven't really seen a full Vietnam War movie before. There are beautiful shots of the Vietnam jungle, and absolutely gut-wrenching when you see innocent people hurt in this area. And it's even more angering when you witness US soldiers (that should be representing the best of America) acting like assholes. Sargean Barnes was a very frustrating evil character, which speaks to how well he was written and performed. 

The one iconic shot with Willem Dafoe was awesome to watch.

I was surprised with how stacked this star cast is. Cool to know that this film was the stepping stone for many into other realms.

I have mixed thoughts on if the film should have incorporated more political background. On one side, I understand that this film is focused on the human condition within the Vietnam war. On the other hand, maybe the political reasons around the US in the Vietnam war could've added to the frustrations experienced amongst the US soldiers. 

At the end of the day, I don't think this is as good as many other war movies out there. The pacing was off. Charlie Sheen's voice over usually took me out of the film, because I wanted to be shown rather than told certain information. Emotional beats weren't consistent. Many scenes of US soldiers doing drugs was an annoying watch.

This has great commentary about the difficulties of the healthcare system. Healthcare is expensive, and funding it is such a challenge. The people that least deserve health issues are the ones that are affected by them. As much as you'd want to hate this tech company for their seemingly rude capitalist practices, you know that it has happen to keep the funding. And the funding is how all these people can stay alive.

The episode is further appreciated with how the lead couple is presented. They are everyday teachers and construction workers that do important work, but heavily underpaid. Their vacations are the same simple driving trips. Most importantly, they bring forth the strongest aspect of love to each other: sacrifice. I wish more content can present people like this. And it was even more frustrating to see them suffer through these issues.

A more minor aspect of the episode, but something that made me feel really uncomfortable was when the premium tier version had the feature to alter the spectrum of emotions. It creeped me out in the same way as the genetic practices in <i>Gattaca</i>. Technology that goes a step further to mess with nature really sets me the wrong way.

Without spoiling anything, I loved how the episode ended. A perfect way to conclude the concept of ""we did it, but at what cost?""
